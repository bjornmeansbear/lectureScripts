# These Gestures Are Undoubtedly Utopian Attempt

This is a talk about designing. About living. About climate change. About struggling. About how one's work, one's practice, one's thinking might align and diverge... Praxis? Utopian Gestures?

I'll try to keep it short and interesting. :)

## A Lamp Design:

* 20191207 back to that lamp idea. So its a bamboo lamp; bamboo is the main material for constructing lamp pieces. The bamboo should be found; it should be an invasive species. it should be cut long, try not to cut it more? again? how can it be reused afterward? how can it be attached/affixed to things without doing much damage to it so it can be used again!
* 20191208 two long bamboo poles. one 5 gallon bucket. rocks or construction debris. painters light. A recipe for a lamp.
* 20191209 three long bamboo poles. one painters light. another recipe for a lamp.
* 20191210 These lamps come together from found material, easy to get materials. they then live as a lamp as needed. they then go back to their original parts or can be remade in a different way, when the lamp is no longer necessary.
* 20191211 how is this part of a local and/or circular economy?
* 20191212 waste = food? do these lamp ideas fit into that? design that does not exist? do they fit into that?

20191229 pragmatic utopian. signs on substrates signalling sustainability. how to put that together? how to put it together for clients? for graphic design?

20191225 what other sings signaling sustainabiity can I invent? do I need to invent any mrore or do I just need to fins a better way of finding and documenting everything else already out there? exhibition? photo/image essay?

# BauErden (Build Earth)

Earthstronauts.

The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in the carbon cycle. No longer can we produce ​meaningless prints, tchotchkes, devices, apps, objects, and software. ​ No design shall be created without first asking “does this need to exist?” -- “does this help drawn down carbon from the atmosphere?” -- “does this re-balance natural systems?”

We need the conscious​, cooperative effort of all artists, designers, politicians, craftspeople, scientists, farmers, parents, small business owners, etc. A new design education must aid in this. How might a new pedagogical approaches focus on the liminal; designers as connectors? For everything is connected.

Designers must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of “climate” as a holistic entity AND in its separate, interconnected parts (climate(s): natural, social, etc.? _the_ planetary climate? the earth? nature? the universe?). Only then will our designing be imbued with the spirit it has lost as mere servant of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ are not capable of producing the required new unity. Abandon them. New styles, new processses, new ways of working, of making, and of seeing are required.​

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the internet, the ocean depths, the lecture hall, the meadow, the studio, and the public square. Designers must be the nexus between new interests and needs. Our client is our climate. Our goals: drawing down carbon, the welfare of all life, and the restoration of spaceship earth.

Good luck.

## Good things to try and work through?:

How to move towards a more sustainable graphic design practice?

Part of this is transitioning clients, amterials, etc. towards “better” options. And my GNU/Linux (F/LOS genereally) experiments are another such effort.

Reusing old design ideas another. (Design-a-Days; Kit-of-Parts)

Now, one might ask if spending hundreds of hours trying to relearn a workflow and tooling in GNU/Linux is sustainable though (the general open sourcery as a whole is SOOOO mcuh work to transition too)?

But, The GNU ecosystem is fully into reusing old ideas -- just reusing ideas period.

Free software allows for creative waste to become creative food.

This is a sustainable ideal: WASTE = FOOD

Does that make free software as a whole more sustainable?

The ecosystem for libre tools is more like a natural ecosystem: you see darwinian style evolution; variations due to minor differences of philosophy or habit or desire.

If the way our tools are built and subsequently evolve is more like nature; more like natural cycles/processes; does that make those tools then fit into our lives, society, culture -- whatever -- in more "natural" ways? does it allow for more natural ways of using them? (natural meaning finding harmony with nature; being more "a part" of nature rather than "apart" from nature... (something about Eli Heuer's open source over estimates your skills, so you have to learn and grow and try harder? -- <https://twitter.com/eliheuer/status/1081627442220068865>))

Do the ideals of F/LOSS align better with the ideals of sustainability?

Does "all humans and other life should flourish" fit into F/LOSS as an ideal? (go into flourishing and bruce mau's design for the welfare of all life stuff here? get some blurbs from my Towards Sust Aesthetics essay?)

Or rather, does F/LOSS help achieve flourishing more than proprietary software might/will?

What I am really trying to suss out here is where and how do my interests in Design serving a flourishing/wellfare of all life agenda and my interests in F/LOSS design overlap; how are they additive; how do they serve each other.

The other direction this goes, is why do any of this at all? why design? why compute? why care about liberated tools? why be a designer -- why am I not just a farmer or garbage collector or something?

Okay, reasoning: our current capitalist constructs DO NOT improve the wellfare of all life; the origins of F/LOSS are also anti-capitalist -- or at least anti valuing making a buck over being good to your neighbor -- so, if you have to use software, F/LOSS is more likely to AID you in helping all life flourish than proprietary/non-free softwares. but, Is this provable? or measurable?

Waste = Food; what other ways can I find that this is true for creative kinds of waste? As I mentioned before I think that in some ways F/LOSS improves upon this equation.

The philosophical issue I run into here is, well, what exactly is my goal as a designer? what do I want to design? is designing solving any of the problems I am pointing out -- did it just create them in the first place?

The Libre Designer; The Sustainabilitist Designer; Are the tools the connection? are these things the same? It feels like a synergy...

Is this also how vernacular patterns/building come into the picture -- are free/libre open models the new vernacular (is that how I make my designing today more like the way say a Cape Cod house comes together?)

Dunne and Raby propose that design should explore activities and outcomes that question and challenge status quo industrial agendas--however! for the most part the designers doing this are still using status quo tools! Sustainability (at least the flourishing variety I am interested in) is NOT the current status quo; so if I am challenging the assumptions of contemporary design and capitalist consumerism, then I need non-capitalist consumerist tools to do that with--enter F/LOSS.

Why have a process? What is a process? what is process? How do you define process?

Does "Switch to libre tools" count as a process? Is “switch to low carbon, fossil fuel free, negative carbon tools” a process?

Sustainable Graphic Design is a mindset, not necessarily a checklist of "the right" materials -- now, it can't be the wrong materials either, but it's not just the right materials...

If you have the right mindset, but still use the wrong materials, does it matter?

If one uses better materials, but for the status quo aims, does it matter?

In what ways can I change how I work and live to yield immediate results?

Waste = Food is a great idea to apply to more things than just the natural world. Here's a great prompt: the earth's major nutrients are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, & nitrogen ... what are graphic design's major nutrients? (and! how can they be cycled and recycled into new graphic design indefinitely?????????)

I have this idea -- sustainable graphic design does not exist. Now, that might mean "there is no such graphic design that can count as sustainable -- its all wasteful garbage that does nothing good" -- or -- and this is the cool part -- sustainable graphic design doesn't exist meaning that it comes together to serve a communication purpose; deliver a semiotic message; and then redistributes back to whatever energy and matter it was before.

That's more than just reuse for packaging or something; that is about harnessing a more entropic way of being.

Sustainability is about knowing what you want to sustain. Libre tools are about a person's freedom to do what they want. If I don't want to sustain our moderno-techno-capitalism, then I should probably use libre tools while creating alternatives... what do I want to sustain though? It is easy to say what I don't want to sustain; less clear to say what I do want to.

Designer as Activist. Designer as Farmer. Designer as Politician. Designer as general good doer out in the world -- not in the social design-y way, but just as regular person doing things to improve the contexts of their time and space.

What good do any of my design "tools" do me if just being a general good citizen; a general good human; is what I am after?

A designer needs to know a lot to really be good these days. I don't mean good as in makes formally pleasing work; I mean good as in really improves things; really exemplifies other ways of thinking and being. So how does one get this way? is this something to be learned? something to be taught? Is pedagogy buildable from these thoughts? If i teach in a graphic design program still rooted mainly in typography and static, flat, two-dimensional printed forms, can I do what I am proposing/asking here? How do I learn enough about materials, behaviors, situations, philosophy, history, physics, energy, biology, sociology, anthropology, politics, etc. ...

If sustainable designers don't make design; what do we make?

Also! who do I need my next clients to be? If I am all in on the sustaino-libre stuff; what are the kinds of things I must investigate? And, how does being a "graphic designer" play into all this when/if/as my projects become more about software development; more about building bicycles; more about actions or interventions; more about proposals and plans?

Quality is essential because quantity is impossible.

Sustainability is essential because there are no other options. Is it about sustainability. What do we want to sustain? Is sustaining really the point? how do we make it improved over time; how do we make it restorative over time.

Do more with less. Do the most with nothing (do everything with nothing?). Sustainable graphic design does not exist.

I know I like to say how the sustainabilitist principles project exemplifies "sustainable design does not exist" since the objects came together to be a sculpture for an exhibition and then went back to being the objects afterward -- but how does that work for other kinds of projects? can I work with clients and still pitch that kind of solution?

mostly what is good is what is familiar.

I have some cyclical thinking. You need to make a lot; look at a lot; think a lot to really understand goodness. You also need to have varying levels of goodness and badness around you to really comprehend good vs bad. You have to have tried a lot; experienced a lot; been open to researching many things; many ways; etc.

How does one really then make good design? what is definitively good? I think there are good and bad behaviors; how does that translate to making of visuals?

And can something be good if it isn't sustainable? can something be good if it isn't F/LOS? < or at least doesn't value the human, the planet, and not diminish the opportunities of both!?

Less is More. More is Less. Less is a Bore. Boring is less exciting. Is more stuff then more exciting? is that the point of designing? Do more with Less. What does that actually entail or imply?

What does sustainable design look like? should it look intentionally different to tell everyone that its not the same? If the paradigm must shift; then the styles should probably shift as well to be clear that they are in all ways different? By just using different tools and typefaces and image sources do you do this? does it need to be more extreme than that?

on the extreme side; there is this "Sustainable graphic design does not exist" idea I've had for a while. The point is not that literally you can't make it (though that is sort of what I was thinking at first), but that a graphic designed thing that is sustainable comes together to communicate the message it needs to communicate; and then can dematerialize back to its initial parts once the communicative need is over. How does "signs on a substrate" translate to "pieces coming together for a determinate amount of time and then returning to their constituent pieces"

Sustainabilitize a graphic design so that it lives forever? wait, is this the point? If sustainable graphic design doesn't exist -- meaning that things come together to server a purpose then can go back to their original constituent parts -- does a piece of GD need to live forever? perhaps this is better put through the lens of perennial agriculture or permaculture or no till or something? what is perennial graphic design that is restorative to culture -- that protects and builds cultural health (the same way that prairie grasses build and protect the soil health of the plains?).

I don't need to practice what I preach; I need to preach even if I don't/can't yet practice it -- keep things moving forward faster and better even if I myself am not yet capable of fully embracing it all.

Start to explain the reduce/reuse/recycle exercises from Sustainable graphic design: why was it useful? what is it good for? how do those things help with design processes generally?

That is important to me sustainability wise too -- restorative design wise? -- but that I need to get more towards real projects; real people; and real improvements… But what does that mean? what is "real"? Real as in things that affect regular people's lives? can it still be utopian AND be real? is this where the pragmatic utopianism comes in?

A responsible designer. A socially responsible designer. An environmentally responsible designer. How does one actually do this all? What is a responsible designer???

What are the implications of designing in the crisis filled era we find ourselves? what does "graphic designing" do to heal and restore the world? how does can making anew unmake all the old? And what the fuck does my practice have to do with any of it. Why can't I make anything useful myself??????s (this is more than a sentence). Okay. So what am I going to do. (and why be so open in an open source readme?). Why is it so easy to do nothing; and not the right kind of nothing.

What are local and reusable materials I could start playing with? making my own paper? creating sheets of remade plastic "paper"? digging and making my own clay to make tablets out of? firing pages that way? what do I produce with those things? plates to print from? stamps? seals? do I draw and compose right into clay? what else allows me to put "signs on substrates" in a meaningful way that continues to let me "graphic design" but really does something about material usage; education; communication; etc???

Am I a sustainable designer? or am I a sustainable person that happens to design -- everything I design is thus influenced by my sustainabilitism. Designing follows one's personhood?

What is the goal of "designing." If everything is a design project; is making new forms important; isn't just fixing what needs fixing an example of "good design" -- does the solution need to be novel? (I'm saying, if I design and sew a travelling silverware roll using salvaged cloth and found random silverware is that any less of a design project than designing a new folding "hobo knife" ???) IF the answer is no, it's not different, then wtf, what am I do, what am I teaching? If the answer is yes, it is different; do I want to be a "designer" then? Why not just a vernacular crafter or maker or builder or whatever?

Is this counterculture modernism? Whole earthers did some things like this right? Zomes? Papanek's coffee can radio? A lot of reuse; but with the goal of making things people need in the moment? Still new things; but a repurposed or reconfigured materials based on what is at hand; what is readily available? What is design: making things we want? making things we need? Solving problems? what problems? whose problems? What does it take to make "sustainability" or "restorative design" or whatever you want to call it to take on in mainstream culture/society? does it need to be more of a religion? more of a political party? Do there need to be more movies or kids shows or whatever that fully embrace doing something about climate change as their theme to affect a change? Regular TV news? obviously the current journalism does little. What else can I speculatively brainstorm? science fiction books are a plenty. Even scifi films are plentiful. Why don't people get it? How to cause this sea change? is it because of the hopelessness? the helplessness? the monumentality? Can we make this a WWII like "war effort" to fight the evils of climate change? Reframe everything in the context of us against the greenhouse gasses -- C02 increasing is the same as the Nazi's winning Europe? What other ways of framing this are there? I need to try more! That's another potential win for Graphic Design -- communicating this in as many ways as is possible.

How does graphic design take carbon back out of the atmosphere? what can communication design; what can signs on substrates; do to get carbon back into the ground? to keep carbon bottled up? does making bricks of plastic and then shaving them into paper help? does making my own paper from used clothes and scrap paper help? what else can I do??? just picking risograph isn't enough. Just buying some renewable offsets isn't enough. (though I guess I need to get on that train again just to be safe). How does this bake into designing generally? to design pedagogy? to society at large?

Stabilizing the climate isn't about reducing emissions, we have to _zero_ our emissions; & actually remove carbon from the atmosphere. Driving an EV doesn't cut it.... replacing a car w/ a used bicycle & your lawn with a permaculture garden is a better start.

Signs on Substrates. Carbon capture.

to change a system; intervene in small ways around the edges ... at some point that system will react to those changes and be made to change ??? is this true? can this work? small is not less important than big in a complex system.

Designing Tomorrow's World Today.

What design does this; what did the messaging around Ozone depletion look like? What about carson's silent spring related anti-chemical rhetoric? what about WWII "we need you" type things? Oh man, that's a great resource -- war time propoganda posters. Does that stuff work now? what is cultural convincing design now? what is design that causes people to follow and just do?

Survival of the most generous interconnected groups.

I do like this life-affirming design thing. How do I get more into that? or rather how do I frame any and all projects moving forward from that vantage?

Every graphic design problem's answer is not a book; or a poster; or an identity... it is not necessarily a visual design problem; or rather some superficial 2D surface decoration isn't the answer to every problem -- though the thinking of a designer might reveal an interesting solution still... Can it always be framed as signs on substrates (signs on surfaces?) even if not a visual "answer"?

Idea: A book printed in an ink that acts as a carbon sink -- the book's text only shows up gradually; it has to absorb the carbon to become black!!??

I've made some cool connections lately; have some cool ideas. How to turn them into action and new projects? where does making cargo bikes and plastic recyclling and fabricating machinery fit into my design practice? how do I collaborate with people in SF, Utah, Champaign, New york, Paris, Richmond, etc. in a low energy and high impact way?

Power my practice on solar. How? what do I need to do? is sleeping more a good option for saving power? can I turn off the internet at specific times of day? how do we all just generally use less; waste less; be more smart and responsible. Why are everyone's wifi routers on all day and all night when we mostly aren't even in our house or using them????????

how does graphic designing remove carbon? can a book recycle plastic? what logo captures the most carbon? what typeface uses the least energy and/or ink? what aesthetic is the most decolonizing? whose bias am I perpetuating? does designing matter? is building a wetland better than building a website? is using solar power better than writing all this shit down? should I just be a farmer in south dakota?

if sustainability is a totally cyclical, restorative, resilant, flourishing, non-anthropocentric, anti-entropy, maintenance-based, stewardship, co-existing thing...... what? you cannot expect everyone to understand what you mean by sustainability -- so do we need other words; or do we just need to say that we mean all those other things when we say sustainability. it is a shorthand sign for all those other words...

Sustainability I guess must become the message of every cultural medium? if you are an actor or director or writer for tv or movies -- everything you write or act in or direct needs to tackle climate change in some way; all the episodes of a show; the plot of every movie. Likewise for musicians. Why aren't there more protest songs w/ a sustainabilitist themes? Instead of give peace a chance, we need give sustainability a chance. I mean, give regenerative design a chance doesn't quite roll of the tongue the same way... but hopefully you get the point?

what does sustainable design act like? feel like? how does sustainable design sustain its goals out in the world?

I still don't know what sustainable design looks like. > Can an aesthetic carry and ideology?

Is maintenance a principle of sustainability? of sustainable design? is that a new paradigm for designing? Design for maintenance. What does maintenance mean in graphic designing?

Maintenance for cars, maintenance for houses, maintenance for websites, maintenance for logos? Does it just not work that way? what does that even mean anyway -- you can repaint a house, fix a few trim boards, but keep it mainly the same house -- is that a sort of evolutionary logo design process? I guess the way to start would be what would maintenance mean in my own design practice? do I already do that in some way shape or form? The magazines I have designed for a while, is it maintenance to slowly evolve their design? is it maintenance to fix and fine tune the paragraph styles, etc. over time?

should I just be a farmer? become a professor somewhere more rural and then have a carbon sink permaculture property? am I useful in this time and space the way I choose to act and interact?

Design is about being a connector. Design is about being a node, being a nexus, and bringing people and ideas and problems and solutions together. Design only works when it is trying to really achieve a success for humanity; for the planet; for the welfare of all life. This is an attitude. Design is an attitude that can be brought to all aspects of a person's life (see deiter rams?).

Am I a sustainable designer? or am I a sustainable person that happens to design things?

We do not have unlimited energy. We do not have unlimited resources. How does this change our relationship with designing? With capitalism? with our economic ideals?

Low-Tech Magazine > good sign signalling sustainability.

What's the sustainability version of david reinfurts "new" design program book!?

Design when everyone designs? is that really what social design is about? what can I learn from Mike weikert and the center for social design?

Who else to bring in? who else to collaborate with? what else to design? what is useful for designing? how does one achieve the right formal fitness?

variations on bamboo lamps; utilize found materials only?

that's not graphic design though; that's not really communication design; how to do graphic design or digital or web projects that are really sustainabilitist?

is that not important though? is just doing anything that can help provide more signalling for design to have different/better alternatives a good choice of project? a good use of my creative energy? or should I just volunteer somewherE? just work on my house and yard? just help denzel farm or something?

What do I want to sustain? What does the welfare of all life really look like? really entail? How do you actually design for this? What kind of design challenges structural inequalities and balances equity, ecology, and economy? Design that collaborates so as to create lasting, positive change in one's community?

Open source? Sustainability? how do these fit together? What am I writing about? thinking about? how do I turn something with so many random bits and pieces that don't outwardly appear to obvious connect into a clear and short presentation?

Everything is Connected. I say this all the time. What does it mean? how does it have any impact on my work? on my life? on my home? on my practice? on my teaching? on my interacting with other people? Martin Luther King talks about the interconnectedness of all people and things in his final Christmas Sermon... That will be a useful quote at some point in some Everything is connected lecture or workshop.

A carbon sequestering book. So what does on need to make this work -- 1. paper. Some alternative fiber paper; 50% recycled content; 50% permaculture grown prairiegrass fiber or something? reusing waste and practicing regenerative agriculture. 2. Ink. This is the real special sauce. How can something be printed clear; then the composition of the ink absorbs carbon dioxide out of the air, stores the carbon, and slowly darkens to carbon black over time!?!?!?! Oh, and is this compostable at the end of its life as well? 3. Cover. Again, cover needs to be compostable, recycled + permaculture fibers, and perhaps the type/image on the cover is just blind debossed? 4. Binding. Perfect bind? use some sort of compostable glue? What else would need to be figured out?

These Gestures are undoubtedly utopian. What of my projects fit under this umbrella? Where does this start? how far back does it go? how might it be a great organizing principle for my projects? for a lecture? Is my initial Senior project from undergrad too far away to start with? that works -- telling the "I was on an engineering track, then I switched to art..." story? what about working at sundaysenergy? my own grad school experience? how to turn that into a compelling narrative that is also artfully illustrated AND relevant to social/ecological/sustainable things today? the signs signalling sustaainability is also utopian!?

Climate Change. So the climate is changing. What does that mean. Social climates, ecological climates, both. How are climate and weather related? how does graphic design show or make this all more understandable? is focusing on climate change even important? is it too big? too abstract? What's the perspective of Drawdown.org on that idea? What about The Climate Mobilization? How does Climate Designers fit into all of this? What framework or ideology should lead? What about AirMiners? as a community do they have any stronger organizing principle or concepts other than just "get carbon out of the atmosphere and into other sinks?" What is the minimum you need to learn to understand this? to have enough people grok this to actually change some behaviors? to change some social and cultural structures? What does a climate friendly museum look like? what does a climate friendly school look like? what does a climate friendly

Success in climate designers' stated goals means a future where "climate designers" no longer need exist. *Climate designing* is no longer extra, it becomes plain *designing*. Did you use a grid? did you sequester carbon? did you match your aesthetic to you audience? did you reduce your energy requirements? did you kern your headlines? did you restore spaceship earth? No? well then that's *bad* design.

## What does a Climate Designer make

A Climate Designer is a designer engaging with the climate in their work and/or teaching.

In my utopian vision, here's how design outputs evolve and change when you adopt "climate design" as a mindset.

Let's look at The carbon negative book as an example of work Climate Designers should concept, make, and develop: design objects clearly embodying aspects of climate change. And while a sequestering book isn't likely to exist anytime soon, even the *idea* of objects like that is useful. A book like this would require the absorption of known amount of CO2 to become legible — this becomes a sign for X quantity of carbon and helps one grasp what is otherwise intangible.

## Signs Signaling Sustainability

I like to call designs like this "Signs signaling Sustainability." This is the real opportunity for Designers taking climate action — turning every design opportunity into a sign signaling sustainability. Make tangible, make understandable something about climate change. This is doable no matter the project; no matter the prompt.

So this seuqestering book example focuses on "visualizing CO2". But, there are myriad other aspects of climate change and sustainability one might signal.

## Where Else to get Inspired

I am *drawn* to [Project DrawDown](https://www.DrawDown.org) as a framework revealing opportunities for "signs signaling sustainability". Project DrawDown presents the most effective means for pulling carbon out of the atmostphere. Digging into all the "solutions" on Project DrawDown, the ways artists and designers might involve themselves is multitudinous. All kinds of work can be reframed as a "sign signaling sustainability" if you rethink the aims of a prompt so that it fits into an idea from Project DrawDown's table of solutions.

### Reverberation Crosswalk

Take for instance Graham Coreil Allen's *Reverberation Crosswalks*. On the surface, these are fun, brightly colored crosswalks — paint on cement and asphalt; not particularly innovative in the "new materials" or "direct carbon capture." But! looking at Project DrawDown solutions, *walkable cities* is the 50th overall reduction solution. Suddenly *Reverberations Crosswalks* signals a sustainable vector forward. The neighborhood around this school is more walkable. You can't not notice the crosswalks, hopefully this makes you more likely to walk yourself. This concept is cheap; fast; easily replicated; can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc.; AND can help make more people walk in the city. Bam! Climate Designed.

### Solar.lowtechmagazine.com

Distributed Solar Photovoltaics is also on Drawdown's list. And Low Tech Magazine's solar powered website signals how we might visualize energy usage; how we might enable new sytems of powering our tools; questions if we really need constant connection; and how aesthetic choices correlate to physical resources even in the digital sphere.

### DC High Water Mark Project

And you don't have to just signal "sustainable" things from DrawDown... that's just an easy way to get started.

The DC water mark project visualizes increased flooding and water level rise — where these impacts will be felt by you in this place! The water level rings articulates to us "oh shit, this place might be underwater pretty frequently given our current projected future!" Then maybe we can act accordingly and redirect our present towards a future where that is no longer true. Without *seeing* your house or office or favorite park area submerged, even symoblically, you cannot envision an alternative.

### Other SSSs
- Tattfoo Tan, *S.O.S. Steward*
  Enrolled in various green courses and acquired certification for green knowledge. To flaunt my new found title in the form of a merit patch on my gray coverall and wear it during events and gardening session. I'm intrigue by the certification of knowledge and the power that was bestow by the agency that gave the certificate. Partly propelled by the thirst of knowledge and partly to sustain the endurance of going to classes and community service requirements of these courses. (<http://tattfoo.com/sos/SOSGreenStewardship.html>)

- Ecovention Grid/Color palette
  Attempt at minimizing ink coverage, but still getting a range of colors so as to uniquely colorcode each section of a exhibition catalog. ?

- *Climates: Architecture and the Planetary Imaginary*
  Neil Donnelly, 2016. The interior paper gets gradually thinner from the beginning to the end, conveying scarcity and depletion through the materiality of the book. One could easily see something like this in reverse, perhaps a book about sea level rise has its paper get thicker as the book progresses? (<https://neildonnelly.net/#climates>)

- Space Hippie?
- Improvisational Lamps?
- Flower based "down" substitute?
- Amager Bakke unmade vapor ring?
- Print posters on found paper?

These examples communicate additional information as key aspects of their design. They redirect culture towards better *future possibles.* And! this is a great place to work as a graphic designer.

## Future Possibles?

So, I need to actually produce something of substance, something of value. What do I have to offer? What can I write about coherently and succintly? is that important or is just getting new and different ideas that point in utopian directions all that matters?

  - associated addendum ideas?
- Exhibition with sue spaid?
- More Climate designers stuff
- Lectures! Talks!
- Twitch stream more F/LOS design stuff?
