## So you want to be a climate designer[?]

A talk for MICA Senior Seminar, 11/24/2020

## An Introduction

Hello. I'm Kristian Bjørnard.

## A beginning

<https://ericbenson.medium.com/behind-the-syllabus-how-to-introduce-climate-science-into-your-design-curriculum-36d38f14f5ab>

During the summer of 2019 I tweeted at Eric Benson. Eric had this new paper making lab at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana -- he uses some farm land of the universities to grow permaculture grasses, and then uses them mixed with other local agricultural waste to make carbon neutral paper. I wanted to find out more, as well as ask him about some other ideas I had for a carbon sequestering book...

Part of my question was about trying to source ink that would air capture carbon over time, so that it would print clear, and then become black over time... Well, Eric didn't have any ideas for me, other than that maybe we should also talk to Marc O'Brien. Eric thought that maybe Marc's work in the bay area with various carbon capture start ups might lead somewhere on this front.

Well, my carbon sequestering book is currently just an idea for some possible future; but the conversations that Eric and Marc and I started over that idea turned into a longer discussion of teaching climate science and climate activism in college design courses.

A few phone calls later, and suddenly this is more than something hypothetical. Marc and his business partner Sarah Harrison helped launch Climate Designers as a networking hub in the fall of 2019. And then ever since the project and community launched Eric, Marc, and I have been working on Climate Designers EDU. Our goal is to “…graduate the next wave of design leaders who are solving our climate crisis.” In order to do this, we developed this list of questions:
    1. What skills do students need to have in order to address our climate crisis?
    2. How can design educators support students as they start their path to becoming climate designers?

## Designers taking climate action

Climate Designers is a community and a title.

A climate designer is a designer using their creative powers to fight the climate crisis. How can designers of all stripes figure out how to use their creative energies to do something tangible about our climate crisis -- no matter what you design, how can we help you bring "fighting climate change" into your work...

Climate Designers is a global hub for designers and creative professionals from all industries -- the current Climate Designer community includes Graphic Designers, illustrators, Industrial designers, architects, social designers, interface designers, fashion designers, service designers, digital designers ... Pretty much all kinds of designers -- committed to using their creative skills for climate action.

The Climate designer community brings together design practitioners of all kinds to share and master the best new climate action practices. We want to empower every designer to feel confident in taking on the climate crisis.

"Climate designer" is a title you can grant upon yourself. If you are a designer taking on climate change; doing (or wanting to do) work in the climate space; please call yourself a climate designer.

## CD goals

Climate Designers has two main goals:

1. Provide resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take on climate action in their work.
2. Inspire, motivate, and graduate new climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for design educators.

### Practice / Designers taking climate action

Goal 1 is about the professional practice side of things: how to tangibly, actionably, pragmatically move design to a model that considers climate as a key constraint, as a key aspect of any prompt or new project

Help those designers saying, OMG i'd love to do this but... with Actionable, tangible things to do.

See how other designers are doing all this stuff; share what you know about this stuff -- how it might change business plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc.

Let designers drawn to using their skills for climate change know that they're not alone ... help make you aware about other people doing this work! How can we share info, share resources, bring everyone along further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, repurposing old ideas, etc.

### Pedagogy

Goal 2 is concerned with changing design pedagogy.

How do you teach climate design? how do you integrate some of this much more technical, more social, more philosophical work into design courses? How can we help introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large?

Climate Designers is working to help provide projects, syllabi, couse ideas & plans... so you can see what others are doing how to bring this into a classroom and implement as and where possible in any design class/program.

Influence new designers towards understanding climate related issues from the start of their design education.

## What does a Climate Designer make

if we look at what Climate designers is trying to do; not so much wholesale changing the deisgn industry, but changing the focus, chaning the fundamental aspects of "base level constraints" for each project; being more specific about what should be served what should count in the analysis of "good" designing...

what if we take all these solutions from drawdown as ways to judge "good" design? or as ways to figure out who or what to design?

And then designs that fit into any of those criteria become "climate designs"

really really fantastic solutions are those that somehow show you what they are doing in a clear, interesting way.

## Signs Signalling Sustainability (NOT greenwashing)

I call these "signs signalling sustainability" / So something that climate designers might then call their work are 'signs signalling sustainability"

the designs communicate additional information to you; they signal some large idea or seachange.

Take for instance Graham Coreil Allens "Reverberation Crosswalks"

On the surface, these are fun, brightly colored crosswalks -- paint on cement and asphalt; not particularly innovative or special in the "new materials" or "direct carbon capture" front... But then, take a look at project draw down... walkable cities is in their table of most effective strategies at 50th is overall reduction/draw down capability... With this higher level view, well suddenly a project like reverberations crosswalks becomes a climate design project; it signals a more sustainable way forward. Around this school suddenly becomes more walkable. You now notice the crosswalks, and are hopefully more likely to walk yourself... these are cheap, fast, easy to do, can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc. AND can help make more people walk in the citiy... Bam!

so...

Use solar.lowtechmagazine.com as an example?

Curry's high water line sculptures as an example?

Amager Bakke as an example?

So... to end...

## BauErden — Build Earth

[Yoko Ono Earth Piece 1963]

Earthstronauts.

The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in the carbon cycle. No longer can we produce ​meaningless prints, tchotchkes, devices, apps, objects, and software. ​ No design shall be created without first asking “does this need to exist?” -- “does this help drawn down carbon from the atmosphere?” -- “does this re-balance natural systems?”

We require the conscious​, cooperative effort of all designers, politicians, craftspeople, scientists, artists, farmers, parents, small business owners, teachers, etc. A new design education must aid in this — a new design education must help to create this. How might new pedagogical approaches focus on the liminal; designers as connectors? For everything is connected.

Designers must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of “climate” — as a holistic entity AND in its separate, interconnected parts (climate(s): natural, social, etc.; _the_ planetary climate; the earth; nature as a whole; the entire universe). Only then will our designing be re-imbued with the spirit it has lost as servant of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ are not capable of producing the required new unity. Abandon them. New styles, new processses, new ways of working, new ways of making, new ways of seeing are required.​ These new ways must be pluralistic; there is not one new way; but many.

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the internet, the ocean depths, the lecture hall, the meadow, and the public square. Designers must be the nexus between new interests and needs. Our client is our climate; our collective future. Our goals: drawing down carbon, the welfare of all life, and the restoration of spaceship earth.

Good luck.

## Where else to get inspired

I am particularly *drawn* to DrawDown.org.

Project DrawDown looks at the most effective means for pulling carbon out of the atmostphere.

the ways designers might involve themselves in solutions is multitudinous. -- I think there are a lot of opportunties for design and designers in the list.

It can become much easier to see how or where you can act when you think about the various kinds of companies and orgs that might work in any of these particular fields/disciplines

How can a designer help any of them?

can you work as a GDer at General Electric? trying to get on the wind turbine team or something?

## Climate Designers [dot] org

Climate Designers is a website -- <https://climatedesigners.org>

- highlight climate design projects
- host climate design portoflios
- job board for climtae design rols (climate bsae tie in)
- platform for resource sharing/FAQ/Q&A
- educators > resources, networking, etc.
- meetups

## Climate Designers on Might Networks

Climate Designers is a community -- <https://climate-designers.mn.co>

- networking
- get ideas for how to find work; how to find projects
- share innovative materials, processes, etc.
- actionable resources
- realistic tactics
- ways to integrate into education

## Conclusion p1

To me, Success equals climate designers not needing to exist... designer becomes synonymous w/ climate designers; we end up with design and bad design; if you aren't taking into consideration the climate, sustainability at large, you are making bad design regardless of aesthetics, etc...

## Additional notes and thoughts

Climate Designers wants to build a community of designers working towards solving the climate crisis.

Motivate designers to use their creative talents to solve our climate crisis. -- How to combine what you're doing as a designer with climate action.

Responsibility of design when talking about Climate Change? the climate crisis?

What if you work somewhere that has nothing to do with climate change (spolier: everything is connected so, well, everything/everywhere has something it can do or is affecting climate change...)

What can you do without quiting your job? / "I'm aware, but I can't do this at my job..."

You want to do something, not quit your career; so what makes a big impact...

ClimateBase > jobs!?

The role of design & climate change...

Ideologies; the status quo as an ideolgoy...

we need to take risks and be bold

say and do things that yo uthink are important

question existing processes, workflows, materials, methods, energy srouces, computer operating systems, cultural models, whatever...

know what your ethics and viewpoint are -- what is being a repsonsible person

what do you care about

provide resources for all designers to take take climate action with their work...

## extras

A quick preface: Climate designers is the initial work of Sarah Harrison and Marc Obrien... they're the main organizers and instrgators of the climatedesigner.org stuff, as well as the networking site, <https://climate-designers.mn.co/> … And then Eric Benson and I are helping to get the educators stuff off the ground. We're still working on that side of things!
