# Climate Design, Signs signaling Sustainably, Build Earth, and more

[S001 NASA Earth?] [^Nasa]

## Glossary

I'm going to say these things a lot during my talk, so just so we are all on the same page, here is what I mean when I say these things.

- Climate Change:
  People have changed the atmosphere's composition; this is now resulting in changing temperatures, new weather patterns, etc. across Earth's surface
- Climate Crisis:
  The impending natural and social disasters of resource scarcity, massive species migration and extinction, etc. if we don't act on climate change immediately.
- Carbon:
  Shorthand for Carbon Dioxide, CO2
- Drawdown:
  Taking excess Carbon Dioxide, CO2, out of the atmosphere — bringing it back down to the Earth in various ways...
- Climate Designer:
  Designers taking climate action
- Sustainability:
  Considering the welfare of all life into the future; and by all life I mean animal, vegetable, mineral, elemental "life".
- Design:
  The concious act of creating something that improves a situation; Not necessarily any particular adjectived profession.
- Sign:
  The semiotic sense of the word: a stand in representing some other idea or object.

## A beginning [^EB]

[s004 FreshPress?]

In June 2019 got in touch with Eric Benson. Eric has a paper making farm and lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The project is called "Fresh Press" — he grows native prairie grasses, and uses them (mixed with other local agricultural waste) to make paper. I had spent most of june listening to podcasts about regenerative agriculture and sequestering carbon dioxide in soil while re-mortaring my house's roofline. Eric's practice of using prairie grass as a paper material seemed like the perfect place for a design practice and prarie soil sequestration to intersect. I thought his paper might be useful for a carbon sequestering book idea … and so we got to talking.

In addition to how prairie grass builds carbon in soil over time, and I thought that was an important part of his paper, I asked Eric if he knew how I might find or make ink that could direct air capture carbon over time.

Eric didn't have any ideas for me there, but he thought that maybe we could talk to Marc O'Brien. Marc was working in the bay area designing for some carbon capture start ups and looping him in might lead somewhere.

[S006 Marc?]

Well, it didn't — at least not on the carbon capture ink front. My carbon sequestering book is still just speculative idea for a possible future. But! the discussion that Eric, Marc and I did start became a longer exchange around teaching climate science and activism in college design courses; as well as how more designers might be encouraged to undertake their work in climate consious ways.

[S007 CD website?]

Out of these hypothetical conversation around captured carbon black ink and climate focused classrooms a discussion of what sustainability and climate change related resources designers and educators would benefit from was birthed. Two more phone calls later, and tangible things were happening. Marc and his business partner, Sarah Harrison, officially launched [Climate Designers {dot} org](https://climatedesigners.org) in the fall of 2019. And ever since the Climate Designers project and community launched Eric, Marc, and I have been working on [Climate Designers EDU](https://www.climatedesigners.org/edu), a soon to be resource for design educators.

## Climate Designers [dot] org

[S008]

Climate Designers is a website — <https://climatedesigners.org>; and a network — <https://climate-designers.mn.co/feed>

The Climate designer community brings together design practitioners to share and master climate action practices. We want to empower every designer, every type of designer, to feel confident in taking on the climate crisis.

- highlight climate design projects
- host climate design portfolios
- job board for climate design roles/positions/opportunities — A collab w/ ClimateBase <https://climate.careers/jobs/?q=design>
- meetups
- workshops
- platform for resource sharing/FAQ/Q&A
- get ideas for how to find work; how to find projects
- share innovative materials, processes, etc.
- actionable resources
- realistic tactics
- ways to integrate into education
- educators > resources, networking, etc.

## What is a climate designer? /

[S009]

A climate designer is a designer using their creative powers to fight the climate crisis. "Climate designer" is a title you may grant upon yourself. If you are a designer doing (or wanting to do) work in the climate space; you should call yourself a climate designer.

## CD goals

[S010 CD Goals]

Climate Designers has two main goals:

1. Provide resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take on climate action in their work.
2. Inspire, motivate, and graduate new climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for design educators.

### Goal 1: Practice

Goal 1 is about updating design practice: how to tangibly, actionably, pragmatically shift design to consider climate as a key constraint. Make climate change a key aspect of any prompt and new project. How can designers do something tangible about climate change in every aspect of their practice?

We want designers who feel unable to or unsure of how to use their work to tackle climate change to see how others are working. What has been figured out all ready? How does factoring in climate change change business plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc.? How can we share information & resources, successes & failures, to move all designers further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, & repurposing old ideas … ?

How to be a climate designer while continuing your existing job? We do not want to make you feel bad about your position, nor that you have to change positions to work this way:

- Maybe that's picking fonts, designing logos, creating publications or apps and bringing new climate-aware criteria and constraints into decision making: materials that use less energy? typefaces that require less ink? software and service providers that have sustainability initiatives? a local, socially positive workforce?
- If you get to help pick projects or you run your own studio can you look for clients whose missions align socially and ecologically?
- If you are working in-house somewhere that seems ostensbily unrelated to or disconnected from climate change you may just need to ask more questions… find where you can affect an outcome no matter how small. (also, everything is connected; nothing is operating outside of climate impacts).

If you do want a design job directly related to drawing down carbon, or you think where you are is a lost cause, Climate Designers has help with that too: the ClimateBase job board!

### Goal 2: Pedagogy

Goal 2 is concerned with evolving design pedagogy.

The intial work on this front is to help provide projects, syllabi, course ideas & plans that help answer questions like:

- What skills do students (& educators) need to have in order to address our climate crisis?
- How can design educators support students as they start their path towards climate designing?
- How do you teach climate design?
- How do you integrate the required technical, social, scientific, & philosophical work into design courses?
- How can we help introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large?

Climate Design EDU is gathering materials from the Climate Design teachers and professors already integrating climate design in their courses. And as our curated selection grows we also hope to actively generate new resources and new materials to help create even more "climate design" programs and curriculum arcs.

Climate Design EDU has a podcast of interviews with educators in different kinds of higher ed settings that will launch soon: large private universities, small private art and design colleges, and whatever is inbetween. The thinking here is to illustrate where different opportunities and colloabroations might lie depending on what kind of enviuronment you find yourself teaching in. And what you can do in simple, small ways if you're not able to do much about the curriculum as a whole.

## What does a Climate Designer make

That's what Climate Designers *is* — designers engaging with the climate in their work and teaching. Now let's ponder more concretely how design outputs can evolve and change when you adopt "climate design" as a mindset?

To put it more succintly: *what should a climate designer make? what is a climate design?*

Let's loop back to the beginning (everything is conneted, cycles are everywhere). The carbon negative book idea that helped connect Eric and Marc and I is an example of work Climate Designers should concept, make, and develop. Designers envisioning objects from a possible future (FutureCone?); a future where spaceship Earth (Buckmister Fuller?) is restored to it's safe operating range of CO2[^SafeCO2]. Envisioning design objects from a sustainable future and trying to make them real signals a sea change for culture at large in the present. Pointing our peers to an alternate future, make that future desirable which shifts what is possible today.

While a sequestering book isn't likely to exist anytime soon, just the idea of an object like that is useful. Bringing objects into someone's periphery which show you something otherwise intangible, one can't help but recognize and acknowledge CO2 in the atmosphere in a new way. The idea is that the book would require the absorption of known amount of CO2 to become legible — the becomes a sign for X quantity of carbon and helps one grasp what is otherwise so ephemeral, so invisble.

My favorite example of this is unfrouantely another unmade idea: The Bjarke Ingels Group Amager Bakke smoestack. Amager Bakke is a waste to energy plant so clean that only CO2 and water vapor come out of its smoke stack. So an idea BIG had was that CO2 and water vapor would be intentionally trapped in the smokestack. Once 1 ton of CO2 was collected, a ring is puffed into the sky. This ring would then help fathom how much CO2 we are releasing? how to visualize what 416ppm vs 350ppm means so its not just invisible, ephemeral, intagible… This idea lives on in an episode of Netflix's Abstract… but was unfortuantely not made — but what an amazing design idea that gets at how we concretize these intagibles…

## Signs signaling Sustainability (NOT greenwashing)

I like to call objects like these "Signs signaling Sustainability." This is the real opportunity for Designers taking climate action — how to turn every designed object, every design opportunity, into a sign that signals sustainability. To make tangible, make understandable something important about climate change and bring it directly into your design work. This is doable no matter the project, and no matter the prompt.

So these two examples — the book, the CO2 vapor ring — focus on "visualizing CO2". But, there are other aspects of sustainability one can signal.

Solar.lowtechmagazine.com for instance — how do we visualize energy and the idea of requiring constant connection and how aesthetic choices correlate to physical resource based ones even in the digital sphere...

Curry's work on the water line project — how do we visualize what increased flooding and sea level rise really mean; where these impacts will be felt in your neighborhood! The water level rings help articulate to you — oh shit, this place will be underwater in our current future; you can then act accordingly to redirect our present towards a future where that is no longer true. Without *seeing* that, you can't be helped to envision the alternative.

Their designs communicate additional information to you; they signal a larger idea that draws from understanding aspects of climate change. The goal, redirecting culture. The up side? this is a great place to work as a graphic designer.

## Where else to get inspired / DrawDown as SSS resource

I am particularly *drawn* to DrawDown.org. Project DrawDown looks at the most effective means for pulling carbon out of the atmostphere. And so, fortunately if you dig into all the "solutions" on projet drawdown, the ways artists and designers might involve themselves is multitudinous. All kinds of work can be reframed as a "sign signaling sustainability" if you rethink what the project is really about — can you fit any of the aims of a prompt into a category from Project DrawDown for example?

Take for instance Graham Coreil Allens "Reverberation Crosswalks"

On the surface, these are fun, brightly colored crosswalks — paint on cement and asphalt; not particularly innovative or special in the "new materials" or "direct carbon capture" front… But then, take a look at project draw down… walkable cities is in their table of most effective strategies at 50th is overall reduction/draw down capability… With this higher level view, well suddenly a project like reverberations crosswalks becomes a climate design project; it signals a more sustainable way forward. Around this school suddenly becomes more walkable. You now notice the crosswalks, and are hopefully more likely to walk yourself… these are cheap, fast, easy to do, can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc. AND can help make more people walk in the citiy… Bam!

What if we take all these solutions from drawdown as ways to judge "good" design? or as ways to figure out who or what to design? Designs that fit into any of those criteria become "climate designs"

- Tattfoo's SOS
- Ecovention Grid/Color palette
- CGSA book w/ paper thickness increasing?

## A Conclusion

[take risks and be bold]

Climate designers aren't trying to wholesale changing the deisgn industry, CD is triyng to change the fundamental aspects of "base level constraints" for each project; being more specific about what should be served what should count in the analysis of "good" designing…

Success equals climate designers not needing to exist… designer becomes synonymous w/ climate designers; we end up with design and bad design; if you aren't taking into consideration the climate, sustainability at large, you are making bad design regardless of aesthetics, etc… Take those things into account, you're just making design, it would become the bare minimum of success, did you use a grid? did you sequester carbon? did you match your aesthetic to you audience? just become a regular aspect of design.

Success also equals all designed objects signaling their sustainability in some way. While modernism doesn't feel particularly avant garde or ideology driven any more; once upon a time to have a sleek tea kettle was meant to really mean something!
