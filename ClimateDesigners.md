## BauErden — Build Earth

Earthstronauts.

The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in the carbon cycle. No longer can we produce ​meaningless prints, tchotchkes, devices, apps, objects, and software. ​ No design shall be created without first asking “does this need to exist?” -- “does this help drawn down carbon from the atmosphere?” -- “does this re-balance natural systems?”

We require the conscious​, cooperative effort of all designers, politicians, craftspeople, scientists, artists, farmers, parents, small business owners, teachers, etc. A new design education must aid in this — a new design education must help to create this. How might new pedagogical approaches focus on the liminal; designers as connectors? For everything is connected.

Designers must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of “climate” — as a holistic entity AND in its separate, interconnected parts (climate(s): natural, social, etc.? _the_ planetary climate? the earth? nature? the universe?). Only then will our designing be re-imbued with the spirit it has lost as servant of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ are not capable of producing the required new unity. Abandon them. New styles, new processses, new ways of working, new ways of making, new ways of seeing are required.​

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the internet, the ocean depths, the lecture hall, the meadow, and the public square. Designers must be the nexus between new interests and needs. Our client is our climate; our collective future. Our goals: drawing down carbon, the welfare of all life, and the restoration of spaceship earth.

Good luck.

## Intro

Hello. I'm Kristian Bjørnard.

What I just read I call "Bau Erden" or Build Earth. It attempts to rewrite some of the ideas from the Bauhaus withing the context of the restoration of our world, rather than the craft of building, as the main goal designers of all stripes should aspire to.

This idea that no matter the adjective in front of "designing;" for whom, where, what, etc.; all our designs can point towards a different more sustainable future; any design might be able to reduce carbon outputs … thinking about this, what needs to change in practice, in pedagogy, conversing with other designers trying to do this... it led me to collaborate with the other array of people resposnible for Climate Designers.

Climate Designers as a organization wants designers of all stripes to figure out how to use their creative energies to do something tangible about our climate crisis -- no matter what you design, you can bring "fighting climate change" into your work...

So, what is a climate designer?

A climate designer is a designer using their creative powers to fight the climate crisis.

"Climate designer" is a title you can grant upon yourself, it doesn't depend on what kind of design you produce, just that you are a designer taking on climate change -- the current Climate Designer community includes Graphic Designers, illustrators, Industrial designers, architects, social designers, interface designers, fashion designers, service designers, digital designers ... Any designer doing work in the climate space.

Climate Designers is for anyone of any age, any skill level, any amount of time in the field.

Climate Designers (the org) has two main goals:

1. Providing resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take climate action in their work.
2. To inspire, motivate, and graduate climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for design educators.

Goal 1 includes work on the practice side of things... how to tangibly, actionably, pragmatically move design to a model that considers climate as a key constraint, as a key aspect of any prompt...

Climate Designers wants to build a community of designers working towards solving the climate crisis. Let those designers drawn to using their design skills for climate change know that they're not alone. We want to attract more designers doing work in this space... doing work with/for/in climate to this community.

Packaging, interaction, identity, buildings, whatever... you need to know about these other people. Hwo can we connect with one another and share info, share resources, bring everyone along further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, etc.

Motivate designers to use their creative talents to solve our climate crisis. -- How to combine what you're doing as a designer with climate action.

See how other designers are doing all this stuff -- how it might chang ebusiness plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc. Help those designers saying, OMG i'd love to do this but... with Actionable, tangible things to do.

Goal 2 is concerned with changing design pedagogy.

This is about the perhas more ephemeral design related things...
design education, design pedagogy, how to graduate new climate designers. How can we help introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large?

Climate Designers is working to help provide projects, syllabi, couse ideas & plans... so you can see what others are doing how to bring this into a classroom and implement as and where possible in any design class/program.

Influence new designers towards understanding climate related issues from the start of their design education.

To me, Success equals climate designers not needing to exist... designer becomes synonymous w/ climate designers; as an og we don't need to exist once that happens...

the ways designers might involve themselves in solutions is multitudinous. One thing Climate Designers points out to designers strguggling to match their work to their ideals in this regard is to use outside frameworks

I am particularly drawn to DrawDown.org.

Project DrawDown looks at the most effective means for pulling carbon out of the atmostphere.

I think there are a lot of opportunties for design and designers in the list.

It can become much easier to see how or where you can act when you think about the various kinds of companies and orgs that might work in any of these particular fields/disciplines

How can a designer help any of them?

can you work as a GDer at General Electric? trying to get on the wind turbine team or something?

once you get into this space; the "how do I analyze what the outputs of these systems are;" how do they fit into getting the most carbon out of the atmosphere then you start having some new opportunities for how design communicates as well.

## Signs Signalling Sustainability (NOT greenwashing)

So something that climate designers might then call their work are 'signs signalling sustainability"

if we look at what Climate designers is trying to do; not so much wholesale changing the deisgn industry, but changing the focus, chaning the fundamental aspects of "base level constraints" for each project; being more specific about what should be served what should count in the analysis of "good" designing...

what if we take all these solutions from drawdown as ways to judge "good" design? or as ways to figure out who or what to design?

And then designs that fit into any of those criteria become "climate designs"

really really fantastic solutions are those that somehow show you what they are doing in a clear, interesting way.

I call these "signs signalling sustainability"

the designs communicate additional information to you; they signal some large idea or seachange.

Take for instance Graham Coreil Allens "Reverberation Crosswalks"

On the surface, these are fun, brightly colored crosswalks -- paint on cement and asphalt; not particularly innovative or special in the "new materials" or "direct carbon capture" front... But then, take a look at project draw down... walkable cities is in their table of most effective strategies at 50th is overall reduction/draw down capability... With this higher level view, well suddenly a project like reverberations crosswalks becomes a climate design project; it signals a more sustainable way forward. Around this school suddenly becomes more walkable. You now notice the crosswalks, and are hopefully more likely to walk yourself... these are cheap, fast, easy to do, can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc. AND can help make more people walk in the citiy... Bam!

## Introduction

Hello. My name is Kristian Bjornard.

I'm going to introduce the role of "Climate Designers" -- What is a climate designer? what might a climate designer design? what's the point of being a climate designer? what does the community of climate designers offer? etc. And I hope that I can do justice to climate deisgners AND present you a way of seeing design out in the world in a new communicative light -- how might all these signs we put out into the world help signal sustainability in addition to whatever else they are intended to do...

But first... allow me to read you something in progress... a new manifesto

## 1. BauErden — Build Earth

## 2. Climate Designers

If you thought that sounded like what you think Design should do... well then you might be a climate designer...

To do all of this means that

1. Climate Designers is a website -- <https://climatedesigners.org>

    - highlight climate design projects
    - host climate design portoflios
    - job board for climtae design rols (climate bsae tie in)
    - platform for resource sharing/FAQ/Q&A
    - educators > resources, networking, etc.
    - meetups
    - create a community all over
    - workshops

2. Climate Designers is a community -- <https://climate-designers.mn.co>

    The climate designer community is meant to help in a number of ways

    - networking
    - get ideas for how to find work; how to find projects
    - share innovative materials, processes, etc.
    - actionable resources
    - realistic tactics
    - ways to integrate into education

### KB conclusion? Hmmm

To me, Success equals climate designers not needing to exist... designer becomes synonymous w/ climate designers; as an og we don't need to exist once that happens...

## 3. Signs Signalling Sustainability

Some connection to project drawdown?

## SSS > signs signaling sust (to come back to)

[start with imager Bakke demo rig???]

Now, as designers we typically "communicate" -- our works speak to certain audiences.

The main goal then, particularly as a graphic designer, is to make your works speak to new audiences about climate change... How can we signal sustainability in every sign we create.

## Additional notes and thoughts

Responsibility of design when talking about Climate Change? the climate crisis?

What if you work somewhere that has nothing to do with climate change (spolier: everything is connected so, well, everything/everywhere has something it can do or is affecting climate change...)

What can you do without quiting your job? / "I'm aware, but I can't do this at my job..."

You want to do something, not quit your career; so what makes a big impact...

ClimateBase > jobs!?

The role of design & climate change...

Ideologies; the status quo as an ideolgoy...

we need to take risks and be bold

say and do things that yo uthink are important

question existing processes, workflows, materials, methods, energy srouces, computer operating systems, cultural models, whatever...

know what your ethics and viewpoint are -- what is being a repsonsible person

what do you care about

Drawdown.org > what does the most for drawing down carbon

provide resources for all designers to take take climate action with their work...

desinging is deciding!?

## extras

A quick preface: Climate designers is the initial work of Sarah Harrison and Marc Obrien... they're the main organizers and instrgators of the climatedesigner.org stuff, as well as the networking site, <https://climate-designers.mn.co/> … And then Eric Benson and I are helping to get the educators stuff off the ground. We're still working on that side of things!

So I start with bau erdern
