## So you want to be a climate designer[?]

A talk for MICA Senior Seminar, 11/24/2020

## An Introduction

Hello. I'm Kristian Bjørnard.

## A beginning

<https://ericbenson.medium.com/behind-the-syllabus-how-to-introduce-climate-science-into-your-design-curriculum-36d38f14f5ab>

During the summer of 2019 I had a back and forth over twitter with Eric Benson. Eric had this new paper making lab at University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana -- he uses some farm land of the universities to grow native prairie grasses, and then uses them (mixed with other local agricultural waste) to make carbon neutral paper. I wanted to find out more, as well as ask him about some other ideas I had for a carbon sequestering book...

One of my questions was about trying to source ink that would air capture carbon over time ... Well, Eric didn't have any ideas for me ... but he thought that maybe we should also talk to Marc O'Brien. Eric said that some of Marc's work in the bay area was with designing for some carbon capture start ups and might lead somewhere on this front.

Well, my carbon sequestering book is currently just an idea for a possible future; but the conversations that Eric and Marc and I started turned into a longer discussion around teaching climate science and climate activism in college design courses.

A few phone calls later, and suddenly this wasn't just hypothetical conversation. Marc and his business partner Sarah Harrison helped launch Climate Designers as a networking hub in the fall of 2019. And ever since the project and community launched Eric, Marc, and I have been working on Climate Designers EDU, soon to be a resource for design educators.

So, what is climate designers? what is a climate deisgner? who are these people? what do they do?

## Designers taking climate action

A climate designer is a designer using their creative powers to fight the climate crisis. How can designers learn to use their creative energies to do something tangible about climate change -- no matter what you design, how can we help you bring "fighting climate change" into that work.

Climate Designers is a global hub for designers and creative professionals from all industries -- the current Climate Designer community includes Graphic Designers, illustrators, Industrial designers, architects, social designers, interface designers, fashion designers, service designers, digital designers ... Pretty much all kinds of designers -- committed to using their creative skills for climate action.

The Climate designer community brings together design practitioners of all kinds to share and master the best new climate action practices. We want to empower every designer to feel confident in taking on the climate crisis.

"Climate designer" is a title you can grant upon yourself. If you are a designer taking on climate change; doing (or wanting to do) work in the climate space; please call yourself a climate designer.

## CD goals

Climate Designers has two main goals:

1. Provide resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take on climate action in their work.
2. Inspire, motivate, and graduate new climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for design educators.

### Practice

Goal 1 is about the professional practice side of things: how to tangibly, actionably, pragmatically move design to a model that considers climate as a key constraint, as a key aspect of any prompt or new project

Help those designers saying, OMG i'd love to do this but... with Actionable, tangible things to do.

See how other designers are doing all this stuff; share what you know about this stuff -- how it might change business plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc.

Let designers drawn to using their skills for climate change know that they're not alone ... help make you aware about other people doing this work! How can we share info, share resources, bring everyone along further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, repurposing old ideas, etc.

This can be doing your regular job -- in our case here picking fonts, designing logos, creating publications or apps -- but with some other sets of criteria or constraints applied: materials that use less energy? typefaces that require less ink? It might mean that if you run your own studio you look for clients whose work might align socially or ecologically; maybe you go look for a job at a carbon sequestering company? It could also mean, if you are working in house in an office that seems ostensbily not related or connected to climate change directly that you just ask more questions, try to affect things in whatever ways you can...

Oh, and if you do wnat a design job directly related to drawwing down carbon, CD has you hooked up for that too...

[side note on climate base if you are looking for a job! & pitch project drawdown??? to be referenced again later???]

### Pedagogy

Goal 2 is concerned with changing design pedagogy.

How do you teach climate design? how do you integrate technical, social, scientific, philosophical work into design courses? How can we help introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large?

Climate Designers hopes to help provide projects, syllabi, couse ideas & plans... so you can see what others are doing how to bring this into a classroom and implement as and where possible in any design class/program.

Influence new designers towards understanding climate related issues from the start of their design education.

In order to do this, we developed this list of questions:
    1. What skills do students need to have in order to address our climate crisis?
    2. How can design educators support students as they start their path to becoming climate designers?

And now our CD.EDU project hopes to gather materials from our professorial colleagues already doing this in their courses, as well as generate new resources and new materials to help actually create "climate design" programs.

## What does a Climate Designer make

That book idea I had, the one that helped connect Eric and Marc and I, it is an example of the kind of work we hope Climate Designers might help make and develop. Designers envision

My sequestering book isn't likely to exist anytime soon, but as even a speculative object it does something special. Bringing an object like that into your home, you can't help but recognize and acknowledge CO2 in the atmosphere in a new way. This is part of a larger idea I like to call "Signs Signalling Sustainability"

So, this book would require the absorption of some amount of CO2 to turn the ink black... that then becomes a symbol for X quantity of carbon and starts to help one tangiably understand what is otherwise so ephemeral and so big it can be hard to grasp.

This is the real opportunity for Designers taking climate action -- how can you turn every designed object into a sign to signal sustainability...

Climate designers isn't trying to wholesale changing the deisgn industry, CD is triyng to change the fundamental aspects of "base level constraints" for each project; being more specific about what should be served what should count in the analysis of "good" designing...

what if we take all these solutions from drawdown as ways to judge "good" design? or as ways to figure out who or what to design?

And then designs that fit into any of those criteria become "climate designs"

really really fantastic solutions are those that somehow show you what they are doing in a clear, interesting way.

## Signs Signalling Sustainability (NOT greenwashing)

the designs communicate additional information to you; they signal some large idea or seachange.

Take for instance Graham Coreil Allens "Reverberation Crosswalks"

On the surface, these are fun, brightly colored crosswalks -- paint on cement and asphalt; not particularly innovative or special in the "new materials" or "direct carbon capture" front... But then, take a look at project draw down... walkable cities is in their table of most effective strategies at 50th is overall reduction/draw down capability... With this higher level view, well suddenly a project like reverberations crosswalks becomes a climate design project; it signals a more sustainable way forward. Around this school suddenly becomes more walkable. You now notice the crosswalks, and are hopefully more likely to walk yourself... these are cheap, fast, easy to do, can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc. AND can help make more people walk in the citiy... Bam!

so...

Use solar.lowtechmagazine.com as an example?

Curry's high water line sculptures as an example?

Tattfoo's SOS outfit

<https://climate.studio/> > warming globe code on your website!

[Return to the halo?]
Amager Bakke as an example?

## Where else to get inspired

I am particularly *drawn* to DrawDown.org.

Project DrawDown looks at the most effective means for pulling carbon out of the atmostphere.

the ways designers might involve themselves in solutions is multitudinous. -- I think there are a lot of opportunties for design and designers in the list.

It can become much easier to see how or where you can act when you think about the various kinds of companies and orgs that might work in any of these particular fields/disciplines

How can a designer help any of them?

can you work as a GDer at General Electric? trying to get on the wind turbine team or something?

## A Conclusion

Success equals climate designers not needing to exist... designer becomes synonymous w/ climate designers; we end up with design and bad design; if you aren't taking into consideration the climate, sustainability at large, you are making bad design regardless of aesthetics, etc... Take those things into account, you're just making design, it would become the bare minimum of success, did you use a grid? did you sequester carbon? did you match your aesthetic to you audience? just become a regular aspect of design.

Success also equals all designed objects signalling their sustainability in some way. While modernism doesn't feel particularly avant garde or ideology driven any more; once upon a time to have a sleek tea kettle was meant to really mean something!

## Additional notes and thoughts

Climate Designers wants to build a community of designers working towards solving the climate crisis.

Motivate designers to use their creative talents to solve our climate crisis. -- How to combine what you're doing as a designer with climate action.

Responsibility of design when talking about Climate Change? the climate crisis?

What if you work somewhere that has nothing to do with climate change (spolier: everything is connected so, well, everything/everywhere has something it can do or is affecting climate change...)

What can you do without quiting your job? / "I'm aware, but I can't do this at my job..."

You want to do something, not quit your career; so what makes a big impact...

ClimateBase > jobs!?

The role of design & climate change...

Ideologies; the status quo as an ideolgoy...

we need to take risks and be bold

say and do things that yo uthink are important

question existing processes, workflows, materials, methods, energy srouces, computer operating systems, cultural models, whatever...

know what your ethics and viewpoint are -- what is being a repsonsible person

what do you care about

provide resources for all designers to take take climate action with their work...

## extras

A quick preface: Climate designers is the initial work of Sarah Harrison and Marc Obrien... they're the main organizers and instrgators of the climatedesigner.org stuff, as well as the networking site, <https://climate-designers.mn.co/> … And then Eric Benson and I are helping to get the educators stuff off the ground. We're still working on that side of things!
