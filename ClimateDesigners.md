Climate Design

My name is Kristian Bjornard.

[read bauerden]

So... Hello.

I call that "BauErden" a sort of re-imaginging of the bauhaus manifesto with restoring earth as the central tenant...

It's part of what I think "a climate deisgner" is > or at least, should be...

So, Climate Desiners. What is it; who is it for???

Climate Desigers is by and for designers taking on climate change.

Build a community of designers working towards solving the climate crisis. Let those deaigners drawn to using design skills for climate change ... drawn to this work know that they're not alone

Climate Designers is a website -- climatedesigners.org

We want to attract more designers doing work in this space... doing work with/for/in climate to this community.

Packaing, interaction, identity, buildings, whatever... you need to know about these other people. Hwo can we connect with one another and share info, share resources, bring everyone along further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, etc.

Motivate designers to use their creative talents to solve our climate crisis.

Combine interest in climate with your design work.

OMG i'd love to do this but...
We want to help epople with those questions!

Actionable, tangible things to do.

How to combine what you're doing as a designer with climate action.

Also about deisgn education. Provide projects, syllabus, couse ideas, plans... so you can see what others are doing how to bring this into a classroom and implment as/where possible everywhere!

Introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large.

How can ideas like "resource scarcity" become topics for exploration in say, a typography course...

Influence new designers towards understanindg these things from the start.

How can we help all design programs everywhere teach designing w/ this lens? Do instead of saying sstainble design or climate design you just say this is design... if it doesnt' factor in restoring the earth; drawing down carbon... it's BAD design... there isn't climate deisgn and design; there's design and BAD design...

Learn how to do this whether you are freelance, or in an office/fulltime 

See how other deisgners are doing all this stuff -- how it might chang ebusiness plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc.

learn about projects educators are doing

to me, success equals climate deisgner not needing to exist... designer becomes synonymous w/ cliamte designers; as an og we don't need to exist once that happens...

Cliamte Deisgners helps in a number of ways
- get ideas for how to find work; how to find projects
- materials, processes, etc.
- networking
- wats to integrate into education
- actionable resources
- realistic tactics

Seek out work; seek out climate work, setup to become a climate designer

how to get setup?
how to do it?
how to get into it?
whats the journey others have taken?
why do people do this?
what are the philosophys?
tips and tricks
how to find projects
how to charge $

CD.org
- highlight climate deisgn projects
- host climate deisgn portoflios
- job board for climtae design rols (climate bsae tie in)
- platform for resource sharing/FAQ/Q&A
- educators > resources, networking, etc.
- meetups
- create a community all over
- workshops

Any and all designers

So, climate deisgners is really the work of Sarah Hareelson and Marc Obrien... And then Eric Benson and myself helped get the ducators stuff off the ground. We're still working on that!

Okay.

Responsibility of design when talking about Climate Change? the climate crisis?

What if you work somewhere that has nothing to do with climate change (spolier: everything is connected so, well, everything/everywhere has something it can do or is affecting climate change...........)

What can you do without quiting your job?

"I'm aware, but I can't do this at my job..........."

You want to do sometihing, not quit your career; so what makes a big impact...

Climate base > jobs!?

The role of deisgn & climate change...

Ideologies; the status quo as an ideolgoy...

Bau erden

signs signalling sustainability

we need to take risks and be bold

say and do things that yo uthink are important

question existing processes, workflows, materials, methods, energy srouces, computer operating systems, cultural models, whatever...

know what your ethics and viewpoint are -- what is being a repsonsible perosn

what do you care about

Drawdown.org > what does the most for drawing down carbon

provide resources for all designers to take take climate action with their work...

BauErden — Build Earth!
Nov 12, 2019

The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in the carbon cycle. No longer can we produce ​meaningless prints, tchotchkes, devices, apps, objects, and software. ​ No design may be created without first asking “does this need to exist?” -- “does this help drawn down carbon from the atmosphere?” -- “does this re-balance natural systems?”

We need the conscious​, cooperative effort of all artists, designers, politicians, craftspeople, scientists, farmers, etc. Our new design education must aid in this. How might a new pedagogical approach focus on the liminal; designers as connectors?

Designers must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of “climate” (climate(s) [natural, social, etc.?]? the climate? the earth? nature?) as a holistic entity AND in its separate, interconnected parts. Only then will our designing be imbued with the spirit it has lost as mere servant of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ are not capable of producing the required new unity. Abandon them. New styles, new ways of working, of making, and of seeing are required.​

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the internet, the ocean depths, the lecture hall, the meadow, the studio, and the public square. Designers must be the nexus between all interests and needs. Our client is our climate. Our goals: drawing down carbon, the welfare of all life, and the restoration of spaceship earth.

Good luck.
