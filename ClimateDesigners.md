# Climate Designers

What are they? what do they design? what's the point? etc.

## Intro

Hello. My name is Kristian Bjornard. I'm here to talk about Climate Designers. First I'll try to quickly summarize and explain what a Climate Designer is. Then, I'll pitch an idea to you that relates to Climate Design itself... ????????????

## 1. Climate Designers

Climate designers -- what is a climate designer?

Clmate Designers as a community has two main goals:

### The Climate Designer Mission

1. To provide the resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take climate action in their work. 
2. To inspire, motivate, and graduate climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for design educators.

## 2. BauErden

I call that "BauErden" a sort of re-imaginging of the bauhaus manifesto with restoring earth as the central tenant...

It's part of what I think "a climate designer" is; or at least, should be...

++++++++++++++++++++++++++

### BauErden — Build Earth!

The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in the carbon cycle. No longer can we produce ​meaningless prints, tchotchkes, devices, apps, objects, and software. ​ No design may be created without first asking “does this need to exist?” -- “does this help drawn down carbon from the atmosphere?” -- “does this re-balance natural systems?”

We need the conscious​, cooperative effort of all artists, designers, politicians, craftspeople, scientists, farmers, etc. Our new design education must aid in this. How might a new pedagogical approach focus on the liminal; designers as connectors?

Designers must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of “climate” (climate(s) [natural, social, etc.?]? the climate? the earth? nature?) as a holistic entity AND in its separate, interconnected parts. Only then will our designing be imbued with the spirit it has lost as mere servant of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ are not capable of producing the required new unity. Abandon them. New styles, new ways of working, of making, and of seeing are required.​

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the internet, the ocean depths, the lecture hall, the meadow, the studio, and the public square. Designers must be the nexus between all interests and needs. Our client is our climate. Our goals: drawing down carbon, the welfare of all life, and the restoration of spaceship earth.

Good luck.

## 3. Signs Signalling Sustainability

[start with imager Bakke demo rig???]

Now, as designers we typically "communicate" -- our works speak to certain audiences. 

The main goal then, particularly as a graphic designer, is to make your works speak to new audiences about climate change... How can we signal sustainability in every sign we create.

The handle doesn't loolw like ahande? that's what eh's gonna blame that one, well, surpsried you ended up the wat you are.

## Climate Design

Climate Designers. What is it; who is it for; why does it exist??? 

Climate Designers is a website -- <https://climatedesigners.org>

Climate Designers is a network -- <https://climate-designers.mn.co>

Climate Designers is by and for designers taking on climate change. Graphic Designers, illustrators, Industrial designers, architects, social designers, interface designers, service designers, digital designers ... any and all kinds of designers.

Climate designers is for anyone of any age, any skill level, any amount of time in the field.

Clmate Designers as a community has two important aims:

### The Climate Designer Mission

1. To provide the resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take climate action in their work. 

2. To inspire, motivate, and graduate climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for design educators.

#### Mission part 1:

Climate Designers wants to build a community of designers working towards solving the climate crisis. Let those deaigners drawn to using their design skills for climate change know that they're not alone. 

We want to attract more designers doing work in this space... doing work with/for/in climate to this community.

Packaing, interaction, identity, buildings, whatever... you need to know about these other people. Hwo can we connect with one another and share info, share resources, bring everyone along further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, etc.

Motivate designers to use their creative talents to solve our climate crisis.

Combine interest in climate with your design work.

Help those designers saying, OMG i'd love to do this but... with Actionable, tangible things to do.

How to combine what you're doing as a designer with climate action.

Learn how to do this whether you are freelance, or in an office/fulltime 

See how other designers are doing all this stuff -- how it might chang ebusiness plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc.

climate designers helps in a number of ways
- get ideas for how to find work; how to find projects
- materials, processes, etc.
- networking
- wats to integrate into education
- actionable resources
- realistic tactics

Seek out work; seek out climate work, setup to become a climate designer

- how to get setup?
- how to do it?
- how to get into it?
- whats the journey others have taken?
- why do people do this?
- what are the philosophys?
- tips and tricks
- how to find projects
- how to charge $

CD.org
- highlight climate design projects
- host climate design portoflios
- job board for climtae design rols (climate bsae tie in)
- platform for resource sharing/FAQ/Q&A
- educators > resources, networking, etc.
- meetups
- create a community all over
- workshops

#### Mission Part 2: 
The other aspect of CD is about design education: Introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large.

Provide projects, syllabus, couse ideas, plans... so you can see what others are doing how to bring this into a classroom and implment as/where possible everywhere!

So, how can ideas like "resource scarcity" become topics for exploration in say, a typography course...

Influence new designers towards understanindg these things from the start of their design education, and subsequently their careers.

learn about projects educators are doing

### KB CD end:
success equals climate designers not needing to exist... designer becomes synonymous w/ climate designers; as an og we don't need to exist once that happens...

## Additional notes and thoughts.

Responsibility of design when talking about Climate Change? the climate crisis?

What if you work somewhere that has nothing to do with climate change (spolier: everything is connected so, well, everything/everywhere has something it can do or is affecting climate change...........)

What can you do without quiting your job? / "I'm aware, but I can't do this at my job..........."

You want to do something, not quit your career; so what makes a big impact...

ClimateBase > jobs!?

The role of design & climate change...

Ideologies; the status quo as an ideolgoy...

we need to take risks and be bold

say and do things that yo uthink are important

question existing processes, workflows, materials, methods, energy srouces, computer operating systems, cultural models, whatever...

know what your ethics and viewpoint are -- what is being a repsonsible perosn

what do you care about

Drawdown.org > what does the most for drawing down carbon

provide resources for all designers to take take climate action with their work...

## extras

A quick preface: Climate designers is the initial work of Sarah Harrison and Marc Obrien... they're the main organizers and instrgators of the climatedesigner.org stuff, as well as the networking site, <https://climate-designers.mn.co/> … And then Eric Benson and I are helping to get the educators stuff off the ground. We're still working on that side of things!
