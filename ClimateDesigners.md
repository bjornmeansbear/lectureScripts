## A beginning [^1]

[s004 FreshPress?]

During the spring of 2019 got in touch with Eric Benson. Eric has a paper making farm and lab at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign a -- he calls it "Fresh Press" -- he grows native prairie grasses, and uses them (mixed with other local agricultural waste) to make paper. I thought his paper might be useful for an idea I had for a carbon sequestering book and wanted to find out more ...

[S005 drawdown SSS book sketch]

I brough up in our conversation how I might find or make ink that could direct air capture carbon over time. Well, Eric didn't have any ideas for me there, but he thought that maybe we could talk to Marc O'Brien. Marc was working in the bay area designing for some carbon capture start ups and looping him in might lead somewhere.

[S006 Marc?]

Well, it didn't — at least not on the carbon capture ink front. My carbon sequestering book is still just speculative idea for a possible future; but! the discussion that Eric and Marc and I did end up having turned into a longer exchange around teaching climate science and climate activism in college design courses; as well as how more designers might be encoruaged to undertake their work in climate consious ways.

[S007 CD website?]

This initial hypothetical conversation around carbon black ink and climate focused classrooms led to discussing what sustainability and climate change related resources other designers and educators would benefit from. A few phone calls later, and suddenly tangible things were happening. Marc and his business partner Sarah Harrison officially launched a website for Climate Designers as a networking hub fall of 2019. And ever since the Climate Designers project and community launched Eric, Marc, and I have been working on Climate Designers EDU, a soon to be resource for design educators.

## Climate Designers [dot] org

[S008]

Climate Designers is a website -- <https://climatedesigners.org>

The Climate designer community brings together design practitioners of all kinds to share and master the best new climate action practices. We want to empower every designer to feel confident in taking on the climate crisis.

- highlight climate design projects
- host climate design portoflios
- job board for climtae design rols (climate bsae tie in)
- platform for resource sharing/FAQ/Q&A
- educators > resources, networking, etc.
- meetups
- workshops
- get ideas for how to find work; how to find projects
- share innovative materials, processes, etc.
- actionable resources
- realistic tactics
- ways to integrate into education

## Who is Climate Designers for? / Designers taking climate action -- what is a climate designer

[S009]

A climate designer is a designer using their creative powers to fight the climate crisis. How can designers learn to use their creative energies to do something tangible about climate change. No matter what you design, how can we help you bring "fighting climate change" into that work -- the current Climate Designer community includes Graphic Designers, illustrators, Industrial designers, architects, social designers, interface designers, fashion designers, service designers, digital designers ... Pretty much all kinds of designers. The unifying element: designers committed to using their creative skills for climate action.

"Climate designer" is a title you can grant upon yourself. If you are a designer taking on climate change; doing (or wanting to do) work in the climate space; you can call yourself a climate designer.

## CD goals

Climate Designers has two main goals:

1. Provide resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take on climate action in their work.
2. Inspire, motivate, and graduate new climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for design educators.

### Practice

Goal 1 is about the professional practice side of things: how to tangibly, actionably, pragmatically move design to a model that considers climate as a key constraint, as a key aspect of any prompt or new project

Help those designers saying, OMG i'd love to do this but I can't in my job... with actionable, tangible things to do; help make you aware about other people doing this work!

See how other designers are doing all this; share what you know -- how might factoring in climate change change business plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc. How can we share info, share resources, bring everyone along further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, repurposing old ideas, etc.

you can be a climate designer by continuing to do your regular job -- maybe that's picking fonts, designing logos, creating publications or apps. The caveat now is to bring some other sets of criteria or constraints into decision making: materials that use less energy? typefaces that require less ink? It might mean that if you run your own studio you look for clients whose work might align socially or ecologically; maybe you go look for a job at a carbon sequestering company? It could also mean, if you are working in house in an office that seems ostensbily not related or connected to climate change directly that you just ask more questions, try to affect things in whatever ways you can...

Oh, and if you do want a design job directly related to drawing down carbon, CD has you hooked up for that too... [climate base job board?]

### Pedagogy

Goal 2 is concerned with changing design pedagogy.

Climate deisgners asks and hopes to answer questions like: How do you teach climate design? how do you integrate technical, social, scientific, philosophical work into design courses? How can we help introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large?

Cliamte Designers' intial work on this front is to help provide projects, syllabi, course ideas & plans... so you can see what others are doing, how to bring this into a classroom and implement as and where possible in any design class/program.

Gather materials from our professorial colleagues already doing this in their courses, as well as generate new resources and new materials to help actually create "climate design" programs.

In order to do this, we developed this list of questions:
    1. What skills do students need to have in order to address our climate crisis?
    2. How can design educators support students as they start their path to becoming climate designers?

We're working on anwering them...

## What does a Climate Designer make

That book idea that helped connect Eric and Marc and I, it is an example of the kind of work we hope Climate Designers might help concept, make and develop. Designers envisioning objects from a possible future; and then trying to make them real to signal a sea change for society, for cultural produciton.

While a sequestering book isn't likely to exist anytime soon, as even a speculative object it does something useful. Bringing an object like that into your home, you can't help but recognize and acknowledge CO2 in the atmosphere in a new way. This is part of a larger idea I like to call "Signs signaling Sustainability"

So, this book would require the absorption of some amount of CO2 to turn the ink black... that then becomes a symbol for X quantity of carbon and starts to help one tangiably understand what is otherwise so ephemeral and so big it can be hard to grasp.

This is the real opportunity for Designers taking climate action -- how can you turn every designed object into a sign to signal sustainability...

Climate designers isn't trying to wholesale changing the deisgn industry, CD is triyng to change the fundamental aspects of "base level constraints" for each project; being more specific about what should be served what should count in the analysis of "good" designing...

what if we take all these solutions from drawdown as ways to judge "good" design? or as ways to figure out who or what to design?

And then designs that fit into any of those criteria become "climate designs"

really really fantastic solutions are those that somehow show you what they are doing in a clear, interesting way.

## Signs signaling Sustainability (NOT greenwashing)

the designs communicate additional information to you; they signal some large idea or seachange.

Take for instance Graham Coreil Allens "Reverberation Crosswalks"

On the surface, these are fun, brightly colored crosswalks -- paint on cement and asphalt; not particularly innovative or special in the "new materials" or "direct carbon capture" front... But then, take a look at project draw down... walkable cities is in their table of most effective strategies at 50th is overall reduction/draw down capability... With this higher level view, well suddenly a project like reverberations crosswalks becomes a climate design project; it signals a more sustainable way forward. Around this school suddenly becomes more walkable. You now notice the crosswalks, and are hopefully more likely to walk yourself... these are cheap, fast, easy to do, can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc. AND can help make more people walk in the citiy... Bam!

so...

Use solar.lowtechmagazine.com as an example?

Curry's high water line sculptures as an example?

Tattfoo's SOS outfit

<https://climate.studio/> > warming globe code on your website!

[Return to the halo?]
Amager Bakke as an example?

## Where else to get inspired

I am particularly *drawn* to DrawDown.org.

Project DrawDown looks at the most effective means for pulling carbon out of the atmostphere.

the ways designers might involve themselves in solutions is multitudinous. -- I think there are a lot of opportunties for design and designers in the list.

It can become much easier to see how or where you can act when you think about the various kinds of companies and orgs that might work in any of these particular fields/disciplines

How can a designer help any of them?

can you work as a GDer at General Electric? trying to get on the wind turbine team or something?

## A Conclusion

Success equals climate designers not needing to exist... designer becomes synonymous w/ climate designers; we end up with design and bad design; if you aren't taking into consideration the climate, sustainability at large, you are making bad design regardless of aesthetics, etc... Take those things into account, you're just making design, it would become the bare minimum of success, did you use a grid? did you sequester carbon? did you match your aesthetic to you audience? just become a regular aspect of design.

Success also equals all designed objects signaling their sustainability in some way. While modernism doesn't feel particularly avant garde or ideology driven any more; once upon a time to have a sleek tea kettle was meant to really mean something!

## Additional notes and thoughts

Climate Designers wants to build a community of designers working towards solving the climate crisis.

Motivate designers to use their creative talents to solve our climate crisis. -- How to combine what you're doing as a designer with climate action.

Responsibility of design when talking about Climate Change? the climate crisis?

What if you work somewhere that has nothing to do with climate change (spolier: everything is connected so, well, everything/everywhere has something it can do or is affecting climate change...)

What can you do without quiting your job? / "I'm aware, but I can't do this at my job..."

You want to do something, not quit your career; so what makes a big impact...

The role of design & climate change...

Ideologies; the status quo as an ideolgoy...

we need to take risks and be bold

say and do things that you think are important

question existing processes, workflows, materials, methods, energy srouces, computer operating systems, cultural models, whatever...

know what your ethics and viewpoint are -- what is being a repsonsible person

provide resources for all designers to take take climate action with their work...
