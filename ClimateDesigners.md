# Climate Design, Signs signaling Sustainably, Build Earth, and more

[S001 NASA Earth?] [^Nasa]

## Glossary

[S002 Glossary/NASA earth reuse]

I'm going to say these things a lot during my talk, so just so we are all on the same page, here is what I mean when I say these things.

- Climate Change:
  People have changed the atmosphere's composition; this is now resulting in changing temperatures, new weather patterns, etc. across Earth's surface
- Climate Crisis:
  The impending natural and social disasters of resource scarcity, massive species migration and extinction, etc. if we don't act on climate change immediately.
- Carbon:
  Shorthand for Carbon Dioxide, CO2
- Draw down:
  Taking excess Carbon Dioxide, CO2, out of the atmosphere — bringing it back down to the Earth in various ways...
- Climate Designer:
  Designers taking climate action
- Sustainability:
  Considering the welfare of all life into the future; and by all life I mean animal, vegetable, mineral, elemental "life".
- Sign:
  The semiotic sense of the word: a stand in representing some other idea or object.

## Introduction

## A beginning [^EB]

[S005 A beginning?]

It was 2019. I was standing on my roof, on one of the hottest June days ever recorded in Baltimore, and we were all about to die… wait, no, I was re-mortaring my roofline and listening to podcasts about regenerative agriculture and carbon sequestration… While doing my home maintenance I started thinking about how I as a designer could do something as useful as these soil farmers …

[S006 FreshPress?]

So I got in touch with Eric Benson. Eric has a paper making farm and studio called "Fresh Press" at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. They grow native prairie grasses, and use them (mixed with other local agricultural waste) to make paper. Using prairie grass as a paper fiber seemed like the perfect place for design practice and soil sequestration to intersect. His paper seemed useful for a carbon sequestering book idea I had. We got to talking.

[S007 drawdown SSS book sketch]

I pitched this idea to Eric: using his paper I'd print a book on sustainable design that sequestered carbon. Since prairie grass stores carbon in soil over time, his paper was an important part of my idea, but it wasn't enough — I also asked Eric if he knew how I might find ink that could direct air capture carbon too! This way the book printing would slowly reveal itself as carbon was drawn into the ink.

Eric didn't have any ideas for me there, but he thought we could loop in Marc O'Brien. Marc was working in the bay area designing with some carbon capture start ups — maybe one of his clients or colleagues could help.

Nope. Carbon capturing ink as I envisioned it isn't yet viable. While my carbon sequestering book is still a speculative idea, the discussion that Eric, Marc, and I started became a longer exchange around teaching climate science in college design courses; as well as how more designers might be encouraged to undertake their work in climate consious ways.

## Climate Designers [dot] org

[S008 CD website?]

Out of hypothetical conversation around captured carbon ink and climate focused classrooms a discussion of what sustainability and climate change related resources designers and educators can benefit from was birthed. A few phone calls later, and tangible things began to happen. Marc and his business partner, Sarah Harrison, officially launched [Climate Designers {dot} org](https://climatedesigners.org) in the fall of 2019. And ever since then Eric, Marc, and I have been working on [Climate Designers EDU](https://www.climatedesigners.org/edu), a soon to be resource for design educators.

## Climate Designers is a website and a community

[S009]

The Climate designer community brings together design practitioners to share and master climate action practices. We want to empower every designer, every type of designer, to feel confident in using design to help avert a climate crisis.

- highlight climate design projects
- host climate design portfolios
- get ideas for how to find work; how to find projects
- job board for climate design roles/positions/opportunities — A collab w/ ClimateBase <https://climate.careers/jobs/?q=design>
- meetups
- workshops
- platform for resource sharing/FAQ/Q&A
- share innovative materials, processes, etc.
- actionable resources & realistic tactics
- ways to integrate into education
- educators > resources, networking, etc.

## What is a climate designer[?]

[S010 WIACD]

A climate designer is a designer using their creative powers to fight climate change. "Climate designer" is a title one may grant upon themselves. If you are a designer doing (or wanting to do) work in the climate space; you should call yourself a climate designer.

## CD goals

[S011 CD Goals]

Climate Designers has two main goals:

1. Provide resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take on climate action in their work.
2. Inspire, motivate, and graduate new climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for educators.

### Goal 1: Practice

[S012 Practice!]

> 1. Provide resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take on climate action in their work.

Goal 1 is about updating design practice: how to tangibly, actionably, pragmatically shift design to consider climate as a key deisgn constraint. Make climate change a key aspect of any prompt and new project.

We want designers who feel unable to or unsure of how to use their work to tackle climate change to see how others are working. What has been figured out all ready? How does factoring in climate change change business plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc.? How can we move all designers further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, & repurposing old ideas in the climate space?

We do not want to make you feel bad about your existing design position, nor that you have to quit your job to work this way — how can you do this in your existing role?

- Maybe that's picking fonts, designing logos, creating publications or apps and bringing new climate-aware criteria and constraints into decision making: materials that use less energy? typefaces that require less ink? software and service providers that have sustainability initiatives? a local, socially positive workforce?
- If you get to help pick projects or you run your own studio can you look for clients whose missions align socially and ecologically?
- If you are working in-house somewhere that seems unrelated to or disconnected from climate change you may just need to ask more questions… find where you can affect an outcome no matter how small. (also, everything is connected; nothing is operating outside of climate impacts).

[S013 climate base]

If you do want a design job directly related to drawing down carbon, or you think where you are is a lost cause, Climate Designers has help with that too: the ClimateBase job board!

### Goal 2: Pedagogy

[S014 Pegagogy]

> 2. Inspire, motivate, and graduate new climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for educators.

Goal 2 is concerned with evolving design pedagogy.

How can we help to provide projects, syllabi, course ideas & plans? We're helping to answer questions like:

- What skills do students (& educators) need to have in order to address our climate crisis?
- How can design educators support students as they start their path towards climate designing?
- How do you integrate the required technical, social, scientific, & philosophical work into design courses?
- How can we help introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large?

Climate Design EDU is gathering materials from the Climate Design teachers and professors currently integrating climate design in their courses. And as our curated selection grows we hope to generate new resources and new materials creating even more "climate design" programs and curriculum arcs.

[S015 behind the syllabus?]

Climate Design EDU is also working on a podcast of interviews with educators in different higher ed settings. PRofessors from large public universities, to small private art and design colleges, and whatever is inbetween. We want to illuminate and illustrate where different opportunities and colloabroations might lie depending on what kind of environment you find yourself teaching in. And what you can do in simple, small ways if you're not able to affect the curriculum as a whole.

## What does a Climate Designer make

[S016]

That's what Climate Designers *is* — designers engaging with the climate in their work and teaching. Let's ponder more concretely how design outputs evolve and change when you adopt "climate design" as a mindset? To put it more succintly: *what should a climate designer make?*

[S017]

Let's loop back to the beginning (everything is connected, cycles are everywhere). The carbon negative book idea that connected Eric, Marc and I is an example of work Climate Designers should concept, make, and develop: design objects  embodying the constraints of climate change in their concepts.

[S018]

While a sequestering book isn't likely to exist anytime soon, even the *idea* of objects like that is useful. Bringing objects into someone's periphery, showing something otherwise intangible, one can't help but recognize and acknowledge CO2 in the atmosphere in a new way. A book like this would require the absorption of known amount of CO2 to become legible — this becomes a sign for X quantity of carbon and helps one grasp what is otherwise so ephemeral, so invisible.

## Signs Signaling Sustainability

[S019]

I like to call designs like the sequestering book "Signs signaling Sustainability." This is the real opportunity for Designers taking climate action — turning every designed object, every design opportunity, every design gesture, into a sign signaling sustainability. Make tangible, make understandable something about climate change. Bring climate change directly into your design work. This is doable no matter the project; no matter the prompt.

So this seuqestering book example focuses on "visualizing CO2". But, there are plenty of other aspects of climate change and sustainability one can signal.

## Where Else to get Inspired

[S020]

I am particularly *drawn* to [Project DrawDown](https://www.DrawDown.org) as a framework revealing opportunities for "signs signaling sustainability". Project DrawDown presents the most effective means for pulling carbon out of the atmostphere. Digging into all the "solutions" on Project DrawDown, the ways artists and designers might involve themselves is multitudinous. All kinds of work can be reframed as a "sign signaling sustainability" if you rethink the aims of a prompt into a solution from Project DrawDown's table of strategies.

[S021]

Take for instance Graham Coreil Allen's *Reverberation Crosswalks*. On the surface, these are fun, brightly colored crosswalks — paint on cement and asphalt; not particularly innovative in the "new materials" or "direct carbon capture" front. But! looking at Project DrawDown solutions, *walkable cities* is the 50th overall reduction solution from the table of strategies. Suddenly *Reverberations Crosswalks* signals a sustainable vector forward. The neighborhood around this school is more walkable. The kids are safer. You can't not notice the crosswalks, hopefully this makes you more likely to walk yourself. Additioanlly, this project is cheap; fast; easily replicated; can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc.; AND can help make more people walk in the city. Bam! Climate Designed.

What if we take all these solutions from Project DrawDown as ways to judge "good" design? Take them all as ways to figure out *what to design* and *who to design for*?

### Solar.lowtechmagazine.com

[S022]

Low Tech Magazine's solar powered website signals how we might visualize energy usage; if we really need constant connection; and how aesthetic choices correlate to physical resources even in the digital sphere.

### DC High Water Mark Project

[S023]

Curry's work on the DC water mark project visualizes increased flooding and sea level rise; where these impacts will be felt in your neighborhood! The water level rings help articulate to you "oh shit, this place might be underwater in our current future!" Then maybe you can act accordingly and redirect our present towards a future where that is no longer true. Without *seeing* your house or office or favorite park area submerged, you cannot be helped to envision the alternative.

[S024 Additioanl Info?]

These examples communicate additional information as key aspects of their design. They hopefully aid in redirecting culture towards better *future possibles.* And! this is a great place to work as a graphic designer.

## A Conclusion

[S028]

[S029 take risks and be bold]

Deciding to be a Climate designers means changing the fundamental aspects, the "base level constraints," for every design project; being more specific about who should be served and what should count in the analysis of "good" designing.

Success for climate designers is when "climate designers" no longer needs to exist. *Climate designer* is no longer different or extra, it becomes synonymous w/ *designer*; design = climate design.

Climate action in your work should be another bare minimum metric of success: did you use a grid? did you sequester carbon? did you match your aesthetic to you audience? did you reduce an energy requirement? did you kern your headlines? did you restore spaceship earth? No? well then that's *bad* design.

They just become a regular aspects of design.

Let me leave you with one final ramble. I call this "Bau Erdern" — It's a riff on the BauHaus manifesto. But this, this is a climate designer manifesto.

## BauErden (Build Earth)

[S030]

Earthstronauts.

The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in the carbon cycle. No longer can we produce ​meaningless prints, tchotchkes, devices, apps, objects, and software. ​ No design shall be created without first asking “does this need to exist?” -- “does this help drawn down carbon from the atmosphere?” -- “does this re-balance natural systems?”

We need the conscious​, cooperative effort of all artists, designers, politicians, craftspeople, scientists, farmers, parents, small business owners, etc. A new design education must aid in this. How might a new pedagogical approaches focus on the liminal; designers as connectors? For everything is connected.

Designers must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of “climate” as a holistic entity AND in its separate, interconnected parts (climate(s): natural, social, etc.? _the_ planetary climate? the earth? nature? the universe?). Only then will our designing be imbued with the spirit it has lost as mere servant of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ are not capable of producing the required new unity. Abandon them. New styles, new processses, new ways of working, of making, and of seeing are required.​

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the internet, the ocean depths, the lecture hall, the meadow, the studio, and the public square. Designers must be the nexus between new interests and needs. Our client is our climate. Our goals: drawing down carbon, the welfare of all life, and the restoration of spaceship earth.

Good luck.
