# Climate Designers

## So You want to be a climate designer

A talk for MICA Senior Seminar, 11/24/2020

## Intro

Hello. My name is Kristian Bjornard.

I'm going to introduce the role of "Climate Designers" -- What is a climate designer? what might a climate designer design? what's the point of being a climate designer? what does the community of climate designers offer? etc. And I hope that I can do justice to climate deisgners AND present you a way of seeing design out in the world in a new communicative light -- how might all these signs we put out into the world help signal sustainability in addition to whatever else they are intended to do...

## 2. BauErden

the following is what "a climate designer" should be …

### BauErden — Build Earth

Earthstronauts.

The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in the carbon cycle. No longer can we produce ​meaningless prints, tchotchkes, devices, apps, objects, and software. ​ No design shall be created without first asking “does this need to exist?” -- “does this help drawn down carbon from the atmosphere?” -- “does this re-balance natural systems?”

We need the conscious​, cooperative effort of all artists, designers, politicians, craftspeople, scientists, farmers, parents, small business owners, etc. A new design education must aid in this. How might a new pedagogical approaches focus on the liminal; designers as connectors? For everything is connected.

Designers must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of “climate” as a holistic entity AND in its separate, interconnected parts (climate(s): natural, social, etc.? _the_ planetary climate? the earth? nature? the universe?). Only then will our designing be imbued with the spirit it has lost as mere servant of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ are not capable of producing the required new unity. Abandon them. New styles, new processses, new ways of working, of making, and of seeing are required.​

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the internet, the ocean depths, the lecture hall, the meadow, the studio, and the public square. Designers must be the nexus between new interests and needs. Our client is our climate. Our goals: drawing down carbon, the welfare of all life, and the restoration of spaceship earth.

Good luck.

## 2. Climate Designers

If you thought that sounded like what you think Design should do... well then you might be a climate designer...

### Climate Designers. What is it; who is it for; why does it exist

"Climate designer" is a title you can grant yourself, as well as a community organization.

A climate designer is a designer using their creative powers to fight the climate crisis.

Climate Designers is by and for designers taking on climate change — Graphic Designers, illustrators, Industrial designers, architects, social designers, interface designers, fashion designers, service designers, digital designers ... Any designer doing work in the climate space.

This means anyone of any age, any skill level, any amount of time in the field.

Climate Designers has two important aims:

1. To provide the resources, knowledge, and community for designers to take climate action in their work.
2. To inspire, motivate, and graduate climate designers by providing climate-focused resources for design educators.

### Mission part 1

Climate Designers wants to build a community of designers working towards solving the climate crisis. Let those designers drawn to using their design skills for climate change know that they're not alone. We want to attract more designers doing work in this space... doing work with/for/in climate to this community.

Packaging, interaction, identity, buildings, whatever... you need to know about these other people. Hwo can we connect with one another and share info, share resources, bring everyone along further and faster towards best practices, new ideas, etc.

Motivate designers to use their creative talents to solve our climate crisis. -- How to combine what you're doing as a designer with climate action.

See how other designers are doing all this stuff -- how it might chang ebusiness plans, materials, processes, career paths, tactics, etc. Help those designers saying, OMG i'd love to do this but... with Actionable, tangible things to do.

### Mission Part 2

That was the practical, studio, design practice side of climate deisgners. The other aspect of CD is about design education, design pedagogy, how to graduate new climate designers. How can we help introduce climate related concerns into design curriculum at large?

Climate Designers is working to help provide projects, syllabi, couse ideas & plans... so you can see what others are doing how to bring this into a classroom and implement as and where possible in any design class/program.

Influence new designers towards understanding climate related issues from the start of their design education.

To do all of this means that

1. Climate Designers is a website -- <https://climatedesigners.org>

    - highlight climate design projects
    - host climate design portoflios
    - job board for climtae design rols (climate bsae tie in)
    - platform for resource sharing/FAQ/Q&A
    - educators > resources, networking, etc.
    - meetups
    - create a community all over
    - workshops

2. Climate Designers is a community -- <https://climate-designers.mn.co>

    The climate designer community is meant to help in a number of ways

    - networking
    - get ideas for how to find work; how to find projects
    - share innovative materials, processes, etc.
    - actionable resources
    - realistic tactics
    - ways to integrate into education

### KB conclusion? Hmmm

To me, Success equals climate designers not needing to exist... designer becomes synonymous w/ climate designers; as an og we don't need to exist once that happens...

## 3. Signs Signalling Sustainability

Some connection to project drawdown?



## SSS > signs signaling sust (to come back to)

[start with imager Bakke demo rig???]

Now, as designers we typically "communicate" -- our works speak to certain audiences.

The main goal then, particularly as a graphic designer, is to make your works speak to new audiences about climate change... How can we signal sustainability in every sign we create.

## Additional notes and thoughts

Responsibility of design when talking about Climate Change? the climate crisis?

What if you work somewhere that has nothing to do with climate change (spolier: everything is connected so, well, everything/everywhere has something it can do or is affecting climate change...)

What can you do without quiting your job? / "I'm aware, but I can't do this at my job..."

You want to do something, not quit your career; so what makes a big impact...

ClimateBase > jobs!?

The role of design & climate change...

Ideologies; the status quo as an ideolgoy...

we need to take risks and be bold

say and do things that yo uthink are important

question existing processes, workflows, materials, methods, energy srouces, computer operating systems, cultural models, whatever...

know what your ethics and viewpoint are -- what is being a repsonsible perosn

what do you care about

Drawdown.org > what does the most for drawing down carbon

provide resources for all designers to take take climate action with their work...

## extras

A quick preface: Climate designers is the initial work of Sarah Harrison and Marc Obrien... they're the main organizers and instrgators of the climatedesigner.org stuff, as well as the networking site, <https://climate-designers.mn.co/> … And then Eric Benson and I are helping to get the educators stuff off the ground. We're still working on that side of things!
