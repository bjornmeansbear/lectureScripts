# 20220419 Being Professional?

> so I'll just sort of go over "hey I graduated having done these things," and here's some stuff I've done since then, here are some ways to think about your art practice and how it might tie into some professional options … I'll try to have some focus on my interests in sustainability and "free culture" and how ideologies you may have can be reflected in what you do, or at the very least in HOW you do it?

## Hello

Hello. I am Kristian Bjornard. I graduated from Kalamazoo in 2003. I subsequently got my MFA in graphic design out here in Baltimore at the Maryland Institute College of Art... and now teach design and sustainability courses at MICA as a full time faculty...

## Kzoo

I was originally a Physics major at K, and between a conversation with Dr. Barth in differential equations, and then some experiences I had while on study abroad I had the revelation that I didn't actually enjoy what I was doing… So, I had my advisor change my major, and when I started Senior year in the fall I was an art major instead!

## Stuff I made

I made work like this… these sort of pop-art-y portraits; some portrait and found object photography…

## SIP+

My SIP started out as a photography project... Digital cameras were kind of new, and I was interested in making BIG prints, I was having a hard time with getting film prints big enough... and so started manipulating digital images to find ways to make them bigger, more resolute etc... There were some programs you could buy at the time for hundreds of dollars, that then ran for hours, that would increase the resolution of images (now this is funny, as you can just use a website like https://letsenhance.io/ for nearly free to get INSANELY enlarged images in a few seconds...) … anyway, this exploration led me to vector graphics, and after some misguided attempts to "auto trace" my photos into vector image — I somehow convinced Richard to buy me a strange adobe program at the time, Streamline, this is now just the autotrace feature in illustrator... but at the time it was a stand alone tool. I ended up starting to use adobe illustrator as a painting and drawing tool... So, I ended up with these vector drawings of my photos, and then I could blow them up as big as I wanted. The library had recently gotten a large format printer and I researched cool materials that could be printed on, and decided this plastic substrate, like what would be in a lit sign, would be cool with the other ideas I was working with...

[too long — what's a faster explanation of this?]

## PostGraduation

So, I graduated, and the thing that seemed like it sort of hit the mark of my interests, my abilities with tools, and that it might actually be a job that paid something was Graphic Design…

~I am just going to repreface this all with I was so naive about everything — I had had jobs before, I worked in a glass factory, I worked on a landscape crew, I paid for college, so I mean I wasn't naive about that you need $$$ to live~

## Floating around…

I have worked a lot of different jobs
  - glass factory
  - landscape foreman
  - record label merch table sales
  - cookware salesperson
  - book designer
  - making biodiesel
  - website developer
  - farmer
  - professor

I've done a lot of different things. And I think there are a couple of threads that run through all of them... the things I find interesting, the things I find meaningful — namely a sense of environmental and social responsibility... I do find it somewhat of a struggle to always make "work" align with one's ideals — I have to say this is an advantage of professoring...

As I've gone from thing to thing, I tend to find that my interests lead me to new kinds of work or new opportunites.

## Music

the first design "jobs" I had were because of music! I was probably in 5 different bands at Kalamazoo... and making flyers and shirts and things was a way that later was the obvious starting place for becoming a designer...

## 2024

When I moved back to Minneapolis after graduating I would just go out to rock clubs most nights of the week... I started getting to know some of the bands and that eventually got me a few projects to work on... I ended up interning for a record label, and made a lot of goofy flash animations and things. The stuff I did at K, you know basically just figuring out new things on my own, not being afraid to try something I had never done before, worrying less about the "right" way to do something, and more just what could I figure out to get close to what I was imagining in my head, that got me pretty far at first in these projects.

## Zindren

I would go to "industry" things to try and make some connections, and I met this guy, Sean Zindren, at an AIGA event — the AIGA calls itself the professional association for design — at the time it was the American Institute for Graphic Arts... Anyway, I usually stood out at things like this as I didn't really fit in with the more business-y people, and didn't totally speak the right language … anyway, he asked me what I was doing at this thing, and we ended up talking about music for awhile, and then I asked him if I could bring my portfolio by his studio one day... he said yes, and gave me his email, and then I just unrelentingly bothered him until he'd look at my book...

## Problems

I had a really hard time convincing people I was a designer, or that I could do design jobs... all my student work was paintings and photos and my own attempts at designing flyers and stuff... so it took a while to finally get in the door — but after Sean finally decided to give me chance, and I was able to get a lot of logo and album and poster designs from my record label connections I finally started to convince people to hire me as a freelance designer...

## Environmentalism

While I was figuring out the design side of things, I was also going through an exestential crises related to fossil fuels... I had been trying to figure out what other options there were in regards to driving a car and had gone down a rabbit hole of biodiesel and waste veggie oil conversions to old diesel cars... This led me to a group in Minneapolis that was doing

## Free Culture

---

~I am terrible at code switching, I sort of act the same all the time, and don't often realize that my take on things isn't always the way others see things...~

I ended up in so many bands because, well, the people I ended up playing with, well we each had sort of our own visions for things — so instead of being the beatles and trying to blend a bunch of visions together, we said okay, well when we play my songs we're this band, and I'm lead singer and guitar player... and then we'll play Joe's songs, and we have a different name and need another guitar player, and then when we play Tony's songs, well I can play bass and not worry about singing or anything else... and we could kind of move in and out of each other's orbits in fun ways, no one felt like their toes were getting stepped on... it was a fun collective vibe — we would come together to do something one way, and then could bring in an extra person or leave out someone when necessary — now this would be a DAO and need a blockchain to figure it out, but we just made it work by not taking anything too seriously...

I've brought that metnality to just about everyting I've done since then — find the people to do things when you need to do them, or want to do them, and get the help I need, and be prepared to help others in the same way?

What about free culture?

What about my failures?

What about Climate Designers?

This is already WAY TOO MUCH content.
