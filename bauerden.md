# BauErden (Build Earth)

Earthstronauts.

The ultimate aim of design must be restoring ​harmony in the carbon cycle. No longer can we produce ​meaningless prints, tchotchkes, devices, apps, objects, and software. ​ No design shall be created without first asking “does this need to exist?” -- “does this help drawn down carbon from the atmosphere?” -- “does this re-balance natural systems?”

We need the conscious​, cooperative effort of all artists, designers, politicians, craftspeople, scientists, farmers, parents, small business owners, etc. A new design education must aid in this. How might a new pedagogical approaches focus on the liminal; designers as connectors? For everything is connected.

Designers must recognize anew and learn to grasp the composite character of “climate” as a holistic entity AND in its separate, interconnected parts (climate(s): natural, social, etc.? _the_ planetary climate? the earth? nature? the universe?). Only then will our designing be imbued with the spirit it has lost as mere servant of capitalism.

Old styles and models for designing​ are not capable of producing the required new unity. Abandon them. New styles, new processses, new ways of working, of making, and of seeing are required.​

We must merge design with the workshop, the science lab, the forest, the internet, the ocean depths, the lecture hall, the meadow, the studio, and the public square. Designers must be the nexus between new interests and needs. Our client is our climate. Our goals: drawing down carbon, the welfare of all life, and the restoration of spaceship earth.

Good luck.
