# The Libre Designer
(or; why designer's don't f/los)

>>>>>>>>

For the 20200727 MICA GD Summer Camp version I'll be live streaming on youtube & there will be a live, dynamic document/chat up on etherpad: https://etherpad.wikimedia.org/p/thelibredesigner

>>>>>>>>

I am writing this as a sort of lecture/essay -- but I will first be giving this as a series of live streams on Twitch (I hope); then as a "virtual workshop;" then perhaps as a presentation at a small DrupalCon...

Anyway, the goal here is to point out simple to complex opportunities for a designer to start to integrate the practice and ideology of open source into their practice.

Welcome.

My name is Kristian Bjornard. I teach a variety of Graphic Design classes at the Maryland Institute College of art -- mainly open studios for the seniors where they work on their capstone design projects, and then some web and motion and interactivity related courses for sophmores and juniors, and the occasional elective dealin

## Brief Background?
I first got into Free/Libre Open Source back in 2006. My first real, intentional entry into this world was using Drupal, a then novel content management system, to build websites. It seemed too good to be true -- tons of people all over the world collaborating together to make a family of modules for doing all kinds of complex web things! Here was this amazing thing and it was free to download and free to use for whatever and however I chose? At the time I could never do too much more than occasionally participate in discussions around theming... but! Woah!

I ended up druapaling for a while... and then when I started getting much more into thinking about how design might be more sustainable, I was thikning about vernacular buildings[How buildings learn by Stewart Brand] and then how open source software like drupal evolved over time and adapted much like vernacular biuldings... and bam! I thought, oh, maybe something about f/los was more sustainable? I was also thinking that something like a typeface was important to make more accessible to more people for the purposes of sustainablity -- ... and again, Libre type accomplished this...

The last sort of other path that helped lead me to "Libre designing" was being a publication designer and having a lot of projects with little to no art budget. So, let's say you're told you have basically $0 extra dollars for stock photos or hiring your own photographer, what are you going to do? Well, its another space I found -- public domain and creative commons licensed images out among the piles of the internet... We'll get directly into this soon, but I just wanted to mention that my actual deisgn practice, mitigating the constraints of low budget projects, aslo accidentally led me to the ideas in the presentation...

So I've dabbled off and on with libre fonts, OS tools like Drupal, and then the occasional creative commons and public domain licesnsed imagery, etc.

This really got to be part of my practice when I ran a class about "Open Source Design" in 2018?
(foot note class? footnote AIGA conference? footnote essay about the class?)

(anything else????)

Now, onto the libre designing.

## Introduction?
For this array of ideas, I'm first going to introduce you to F/LOS if you haven't really had much of an introduction to it in the past. Then I'll try to outline from simple to complex how a designer "liberates" their practice. At the end, and throughout, I'll point out reasons that perhaps this isn't more mainstream incase you're not already thinking that... 

Some Trigger Warnings: 
- I will be derogatory towards neoliberalism
- I will probably mention Marx, Communism, Henry George, Mutual Aid, Peter Kroptopkin, and other socialist and anarchist and libertarian thinkers
- ???

The foundations to the Free/Libre Open Source arena has several interesting connections to the greater domain of Graphic Design. As such, I continue to be surprised how little our discipline seems to know about and partake in this world -- outside of web design.

So, two quick anecdotes:

1. Donald Knuth & TeX & Metafont.

2. Richard Stallman & an annoying printer.

If you want to investigate this all more; I highly recommend finding out more about Donald Knuth and MetaFont -- or even trying to use TeX (MacTex, LaTex, ConTeXt or some other fork)... If you like HTML and CSS you'll probably like "designing" documents in TeX. > check out Overleaf https://www.overleaf.com/

You can also read all sorts of history and foundational information from, by, and about the Free Software foundation (https://www.fsf.org/) and GNU (http://www.gnu.org/)...

And then there is "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" by Eric Raymond, which does a good job outlining how Linus Torvalds created his world of distributed hackers to rapidly build and improve upon the Linux Kernel as it evolved... This is also a foundational text for how "Free/Libre" became "Open Source"...

### Libre Not Gratis
Free as in Freedom, not as in price! You can still charge money for F/LOS; the point is to not stop someone from doing what they want with a thing (like when you buy physical objects)

?

### A note on licenses????

So! how to get started as a Libre Designer!

## Tragedy of the commons

The easiest way to get started on this adventure is to change the photos, illustrations, icons, etc. that you might use in a project. This is easiest for several reasons:
1. You don't need to change OS or software -- any "free" image works with any tools you are already using. Nothing to install; turn on; reconfigure...
2. You don't need to ask permission; you're probably already finding these things for projects and clients anyway...
3. You sometimes don't even have to look in new places; just change the way you search/look...
4. You also actually solve a bunch of potential copyright/contract issues by finding "free" imagery

Okay! so what does F/LOS mean to imageS?

So what we're looking for when we are looking for F/LOS imagery is imagery that is somehow licensed for anyone to do with it as they want. This often takes the form of "public domain" or "creative commons" or sometimes the "free art" or "libre art" license.

## Libre Fonts

### Quality of Fonts?
The universe of F/LOS fonts can sometimes feel limited... and can sometimes feel less-than in terms of quality. I would say that in general, while you might not end up with as many typographic nicities; real small caps, different styles of numbers, etc. this isn't always the case. Many of these F/LOS fonts are designed to serve populations, users, audiences, etc. historically not served. SIL for example, an organization who has done a lot for Libre Fonts (https://software.sil.org/fonts/) has many fonts with huge character sets so they could set their materials in as many languages as possible (they provide language tools to all manner of commnunites)...

Often over time F/LOS fonts evolve to have more features just like software, etc. Raleway for exmaple was launched w/ one thin weight by TLOMT (https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/raleway); but was forked and the incarnation that lives on google fonts has 9 weights, and italics, and even an extra display version, raleway dots. https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway#standard-styles & https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway+Dots?query=raleway

Whew!

### Font Management?
Font management is both easy and terrible with F/LOS offerings and on Linux in general. As far as applications for font management go, there's not a lot, and the one good-ish one upkept by a designery person is no longer maintained... So you're stuck manually putting things in the right places. The good part of that is that, well, using MacOS depending on what you're useing you can just use whatever font manager you're already using... Some of the F/LOS tools however, they just don't know to look for fonts anywhere except the main system folder... This is hard to add/delete fonts from if you're a regular computer user... but in Linux, there is pretty much only the sytem repo for fonts, so thus the bias/seemingly annoying "feature" (or "bug" depending on your view)
