# The Libre Designer
(or; why designer's don't f/los)

I am writing this as a sort of lecture/essay -- but I will first be giving this as a series of live streams on Twitch (I hope); then as a "virtual workshop;" then perhaps as a presentation at a small DrupalCon...

Anyway, the goal here is to point out simple to complex opportunities for a designer to start to integrate the practice and ideology of open source into their practice.

## Some Background.

I first got into Free/Libre Open Source back in 2006. My first real, intentional entry into this world was using Drupal, a then novel content management system, to build websites. It seemed too good to be true -- tons of people all over collaborating together to make a family of modules for doing all kinds of complex web things! At the time I could never do too much more than occasionally participate in discussions around theming... but! 

I ended up druapling for a while... and then when I started getting much more into thinking about how deisgn might be more sustainable, I was thikning about vernacular buildings and then how open source software like drupal evolved over time and adapted much like vernacular biuldings... and bam! I was like, oh, maybe something about f/los was more sustainable? I was also thinking that something like a font was important to make more accessible to more people for the purposes of sustainablity -- ...

This really got tobe part of my practice when I ran a class about this in 2018?
(foot note class? footnote AIGA conference? footnote essay about the class?)

## Introduction?
For this array of ideas, I'm first going to introduce you to F/LOS if you haven't really had much of an introduction to it in the past. Then I'll try to outline from simple to complex how a designer "liberates" their practice. At the end, and throughout, I'll point out reasons that perhaps this isn't more mainstream incase you're not already thinking that...

So! how to get started as a Libre Designer!

## Tragedy of the commons

## Libre Fonts

## Now for someting completely different

## Time for an Operating System Update

## New (old) Machines

## Time for practice!

## What's hard? What's Bad? What's not easy?

## Conclusion
