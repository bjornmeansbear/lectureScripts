# What is Sustainable Graphic Design?

Some kind of intro needed!?!?!?!?!

What ties all my work together?

I've been looking at a lot of different things the last several weeks.

## A Place to Start

In the 2013 book _Flourishing: A Frank Conversation about Sustainability_, John Ehrenfeld writes “The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what it is that you want to sustain.”‡1 So, to define sustainable graphic design we must first define what it is we are sustaining.

As a quick aside, here are some definitions of sustainability… Most of them speak vaguely about looking out for the future, or conserving resources, or just being nice into the future, but they aren't clear about what is to be sustained, other than I guess whatever we think our current situations are.

If sustainable graphic design is design in service of what we want to sustain — what's worth sustaining? (this means that if we want to sustain the status quo, then that is what sustainable graphic design is — hmmm!?). Ehrenfeld wants to sustain “that all humans and other life should flourish.”‡2

Designer Bruce Mau actually has a similar description for the goals of _Massive Change_: “Our project is the welfare of _all life_ as a practical objective.”‡3

In this line of reasoning sustainable graphic design is “graphic design in support of all life flourishing,” or “graphic design for the welfare of all life.” Sustainable graphic design doesn’t then solely rely on better materials or more socially conscious manufacturing. Graphic design framed this way may preclude certain types of projects and certain kinds of clients. Graphic design framed this way will have to evolve over time — what is important today to help all life will presumably change by next year or in a decade. Graphic design framed this way opens up the realm of possibilities for what a graphic design project is. Sustainable Graphic Design defined this way is _different_ than status quo design. All life flourishing is not the traditional goal of business, culture, and design.

Throughout art and design history, new thinking and new tools launched new aesthetic outcomes. Sustainable graphic design, graphic design for the welfare of all life, requires different ways of thinking than other current designs. Sustainability brings with it all kinds of new technologies, new social structures, and new tools; so Sustainable graphic design should then carry with it the potential for different and new styles/aesthetics.

## What does our “different” kind of design look like?

What do you visually picture in your mind when you hear “sustainable graphic design?” Is there a particular aesthetic A particular color? A particular archetypal client? A particular feeling? A particular message? A particular set of symbols?

What aesthetic is most sustainable? How do we answer this question? Is it even worth asking? And then what do we base our choices on: energy reduction? Better resource use? Instigating social change?

> ### Aside 1

> Reduction as a design strategy. Taking one starting point and attempting to reduce colors, forms, coverage, etc.
>
> Include Make/UnMake graphics?

Is selecting a font that uses minimal ink the best way to select a font? Should a font’s or grid’s appearance matter as much as the energy and material and social ills it saves? Would a font that is more condensed and thus uses up less space (saving tons of paper over a print run and exposure to chemicals to the printers (I guess we should be spec’ing an inert ink as well (can we make our own inks from oak galls and iron ore?))) be better? Can we combine the two? The thinest, most condensed, lightest ink coverage font is the most sustainable? This can easily be taken absurd lengths.

> Sustainability. Experimental letterforms made using 000letter <http://kielm.land/>. playing around w/ idea of minimal line width and general scale for saving both space and ink coverage.

Instead of just reducing or minimizing resources, could we reuse or recycle? Is there a way to graphic design that uses old materials over and over again? Can we apply the Cradle to Cradle cyclical idea of _waste = food_‡4 to our graphic designing?

This line of design problem solving is limited in its ability to exact meaningful change. It tackles resultant outcomes from a resource perspective; but doesn’t embrace “that all life should flourish.” Negative effects can be minimized, but is focusing on resource efficiencies enough? Making choices around resource use might make “less bad”  graphic design, but it doesn’t necessarily make for _sustainable_ graphic design.

## Ideological, Critical, Beautiful

Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby write in their 2001 book _Design Noir: The Secret Life of Objects_ that “all design is ideological, the design process is informed by values based on a specific world view.”‡5 If our world view is “the welfare of all life,” how does that shift what and how we graphic design?

> ### Aside 3
>
> Sustainabilitist design should be critical of the status quo. How does something visual do this?
>
> Include a design-a-day that fits this?

Dunne and Raby are proponents of “critical design,” or design that “provides a critique of the prevailing situation through designs that embody alternative social, cultural, technical, or economic values.”‡6 This is great for our purposes. Graphic design made for the welfare of all life is different than status quo design. So, sustainable graphic design is not just design that helps people and our planet, but design that is also critical of existing social, cultural, technical, AND economic structures (sort of all the options of the Dunne & Raby list, not just one or another at a time).

One way we judge graphic design is on whether or not it is formally “good.” We would normally use criteria for formal goodness that are a part of the systems we’re critical of. The characteristics we base formal goodness on come from modernist ideals born out of the late 19th century through the middle of the 20th century. What started as avant grade art movements became something adopted by business, government, and general society as “good” style. Our sense of good or beautiful design then is biased towards modernist ideals co-opted by the capitalist status quo. Perhaps those are no longer valid criteria for our sustainable graphic design to be judged with in terms of its formal correctness, or more succinctly, its beauty?

> ### Aside 4

> The Bauhaus. One place to find graphic design “goodness.” This is one formal outcome from a set of ideals. But, does this offer us anything once taken to the realm of the sustainable? does this say anything about the welfare of all life?
>
> A bauhaus graphic of some kind?

## In this new definition of graphic design, how do we define beauty?

In _The Architecture of Happiness_, Alain de Botton writes: “To call a work of architecture or design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in a material medium.”‡7 This would then seem that however our ideals (that all humans and life should flourish, remember) can be materialized into graphic design will yield “beautiful” graphic design.

This then implies that Sustainable designers must see the non-sustainable as the less than beautiful. Edwin Datschefksi calls this “the hidden ugliness of traditional products.”‡8 Basically, the non-sustainable is (& can only be) ugly.

Beauty will align with your values. A design is both sustainable AND beautiful when its form declares that humans and all other life should flourish. Is there a style, aesthetic, or form says this?

> ### Aside 5
>
> The non-sustainable = the ugly
> the sustainable = the beautiful.

## Other Ways To Define "Beauty"?

Bruce Sterling in his final piece of writing for the Viridian Design community outlines four criteria for sorting through our lives' objects so as to decide what to keep and what to discard as a part of a new, sustainably designed life:

- Beautiful Things
- Sentimental Things
- Utilitarian Things
- Everything else.

If an object in your possession fits into the first three categories (beautiful, sentimental, or utilitarian things), then it is worth keeping. If it falls into “Everything Else” be rid of it. (Reduce! Recycle!?) When Alain de Botton spoke of architectural beauty, I think his “beauty” encompassed all of Sterling’s top 3 categories.

But, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Alain de Botton repeatedly references a line from the French writer Stendahl: “there are as many styles of beauty as there are visions of happiness” (pg. 100). This starts to explain why “what does sustainable graphic design look like?” is a hard question. It also explains why Sterling found the need to break his list of criteria into four separate entities, not just “beautiful things” and “everything else.”

To me, a nice hammer is functional, utilitarian, and beautiful. To you, it might just be functional. The paintings and drawings and houseplants I find beautiful are what another might find ugly. The things I find sentimental are probably unique to me.

Not everyone thinks the same things are beautiful. So, is there really no “correct” aesthetic choice?

Perhaps our thinking on sustainable graphic design’s "look" must take it’s cue from this: Anything that helps promote the flourishing of nature’s interconnected systems will look correct. That doesn’t require a particular style, material, or typeface — it requires the right ideals; the right messages.

[[ HOW TO ACHIEVE THE RIGHT IDEALS!? Triple Bottom Line? Nested Areas of Importance? Form/Economy > Content/Society > Context/Nature? Where does Spaceship Earth fit in? ]]

## Sustainable aesthetics visualize good ethics

How might we go about realizing in form how we have aligned ourselves philosophically?

“There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named.  It is never twice the same, because it always takes its shape from the particular place in which it occurs.”‡9

Perhaps the issue here is that the qualities that do promote the welfare of all life are, like the quality without a name Alexander presents, ineffable. And like the quality without a name, the aesthetics that correspond with this, the graphic design visuals that might show the welfare of all life shift and change with different contexts. A wild garden, a cathedral, a monarch butterfly, a thriving farmers market. So instead of attempting to nail things down literally or concretely, a “feeling” needs to be found instead?

## What aesthetics or forms convey a feeling of sustainability?

Forms are chosen to convey certain meanings. Typefaces impart different feelings and intents. No aesthetic direction is without expression. Viewers refer to visual solutions as feeling cold, sterile, corporate, warm, homey, etc. Is there then a visual solution that can convey the feeling of “sustainability?” that can convey the feeling of all life flourishing?

A search for sustainable aesthetics in any online engine uncovers leaves, green things, brown things, wood things, bamboo things… These aesthetic tropes that come back again and again, but this does not necessarily convey a feeling of sustainability, certainly just turning something green does not correspond with the welfare of all life.

Design communication happens in a single direction — from the designed piece to the viewer. In this way, it isn’t really communication, it is signaling. Signaling to the user what is supposed to be happening. (A tea kettle whistles to let you know it is ready, but the user has no communication back with the tea kettle). When we say that design communicates what we really tend to mean is that design signals clearly and cleverly. We mean it in a one directional, semiotic sense. Sign. Signified.

How does a sustainable object signal? What does a sustainable object signal? What signals the welfare of all life?

## Conclusions?

The definition of sustainable graphic design is both an easy one and hard one. It is easy in that sustainable graphic design is just design that sustains the welfare of all life. That is a short, direct sentence. Easy to write down. But, it is hard because, well, what constitutes graphic design that sustains the welfare of all life? What is the _je ne sais quoi_ that makes  sustainable design different, more correct, more capable of doing this sustaining?

Our current tools, ideas, and cultural systems aren’t setup to help us to understand this or to manufacture products in this vein. Part of figuring out what sustainable graphic design is, means we’ll also have to continue to decide what forms, tools, and new societal structures are required to realize it effectively (& help to design these too). Designers as sustainabilitists = designers as good human beings. :boom:

So what is Sustainable Graphic Design? Anything that visualizes the caretaking of our Spaceship Earth …

### Other bits and pieces

“how might graphic design be more sustainable in its form, processes, and ideals, not solely materials.”

In car and building design choices made regarding fuel efficiency or energy usage have drastic impact on aesthetics. Certain shapes, materials, solutions, etc. must be chosen or omitted. What are graphic design’s corollaries? Should one look for the most energy efficient presses? The most energy efficient printing processes? What effect does that have on the look or feel of a poster? A passive home achieves the same outcomes — walls, roof, kitchen, shelter, storage, sleeping areas, etc. — as a regular home, with similar references (people seeing a picture will know it’s a “house”), but will be more sustainable and have a look and feel in alignment with its ideals. What is the “sustainable” equivalent of say a magazine or advertisement??? Will graphic design look “different” when made by people pondering these things?

To make books we fell trees. To power our cities we level mountains. Each act of creation is also an act of destruction. Is this just entropy playing its role — that there is just only so much matter and energy? Or is there something special about how we humans unmake the world around us in the process of societal “progress?” Does sustainable design honestly acknowledge this make/unmake duality? Does sustainability require minimizing the described unmaking? Can newer and more plentiful objects exist without unmaking everything around us?

Waste = Food: As a premise, "Waste = Food" has been most contemporaneously popularized through _Cradle to Cradle_ Michael Braungart and William McDonough want us to understand that our concept of waste is incorrect; we have a problematic relationship with waste. Nature produces no waste; outputs from one system are always inputs for another. Our current design and consumer cultures do not operate in this way. Karrie Jacobs points this out quite bluntly in her essay _Disposability, Graphic Design, Style, and Waste_: designers make garbage. Waste is just what we make -- our inputs have only one output, trash! And trash must be sent away; not used for making more design. Maybe we can change that.

#### What Does Sustainable Graphic Design Look Like? A Thought Experiment with potential answers

Modernism (for instance) was not about style for style’s sake, but style illuminating a novel theoretical position; style that was arrived at from a thought process, from a set of values, or from hypothesizing and experimenting.

Designing for the welfare of all life is certainly a different mindset from designing for the corporate marketplace... do these things need to then look different?

I have seen a few recurring “answers” to the question “What does sustainable graphic design look like?" in my work and work from the field:

1. SGD looks the same.
2. SGD looks eco-friendly.
3. SGD looks innovative.
4. SGD does not exist.
   - A Pessimistic interpretation?
   - An Optimistic interpretation?

"Sustainable design does not exist" was first a pessimistic "fourth way." Is design all just trash? does design create waste period, so nothing is sustainable? Or, literally, sustainable design is not a thing: anything you are making is unmaking so much else.

But! "Sustainable design does not exist" came to signify an alternative vector; it didn't exist because it was ephemeral! because it reused existing objects in a new way! that it left no trace! suddenly this felt like a prompt for new works; new questions! A useful constraint going forward.
