# What is Sustainable Graphic Design?

My lecture today is called "What is sustainable graphic design?"

I'm going to try and present you with a handful of different arguments and definitions to help define the space where visual designing and sustainability overlap. I'm going to walk us through a few case-studies dealing with "what Sustainable Aesthetics might look like" — so we'll talk about materials, aesthetics, forms, semiotics, meanings, and philosophies; and how there are — fortunately or unfortunately — a plurality of ways to answer this question I've posed.

## Quick background

In my twenty year role as graphic designer I've designed books, record sleeves, magazines, logos, websites, exhibition graphics, and built digital tools. Regardless of final forms, if its client-based or self-initiated, I treat all my designs as opportunities for intellectual inquiry and self-expression.

## Define Sustainability? Define Sustainabilitists?

Sustainabilitists take over where environmentalism ends, moving from the realm of the environment into all realms. We must allow our designs, strategies and methodologies to evolve and adapt to new ideas, new hybrids — accept and deal with a constant flux between nature, society, economy — everything.

Sustainability charts…

## A place to start

What comes to mind when you hear the phrase “sustainable graphic design?”

- Is there a particular style?
- Is there a particular client?
- Is there a particular visual trope? a color? a pattern?
- Is there a particular message?

(need something to make this jump)

Sustainable designers should see the non-sustainable as the less-than beautiful.

> “the hidden ugliness of traditional products.”
> — Edwin Datschefksi

If your design doesn't account for the welfare of all life, regardless of whatever external aesthetics wrap it, your design is ugly.

The Non-Sustainable = The Ugly; The Sustainable = The Beautiful

So, I ask again, what comes to mind when you hear “Sustainable Graphic Design?” Something that is truly beautiful. Perhaps elegant? Perhaps constrained? Perhaps Vernacular? Perhaps reused? Perhaps eco-friendly? But always beautiful.

But, how do you define beauty? and what kind of beauty is sustainable

> “To call a work of architecture or design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in material medium.“
> — Alain de Botton, The Architecture of Happiness

Beauty will align with your values.

However our ideals can be materialized into graphic design will yield “beautiful” graphic design.

> “The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what you want to sustain … that all humans and other life should flourish.”
> — John Ehrenfeld, Flourishing

And, Designer Bruce Mau has a similar description for the goals of _Massive Change_

> “Our project is the welfare of _all life_ as a practical objective.”

So, Sustainable design’s form declares “humans & all life should flourish.” / Beautiful design’s form declares “humans & all life should flourish.

A design is both sustainable AND beautiful when its form declares that humans and all other life should flourish. Is there a style, aesthetic, or form says this the most clearly? Perhaps there isn't a single visual way to frame this?

How Does a sustainabilitist account for pluralities as to what constitutes “beautiful?”

Sustainable Design = Beautiful Design

> Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
> — Margaret Wolfe Hungerford, Molly Bawn, 1878

How can both of these concepts be true?

> “there are as many styles of beauty as there are visions of happiness”
> — Stendhal

It's not a new idea that beauty isn't the same for everyone

> "Beauty in things exists merely in the mind which contemplates them."
> — David Hume's Essays, Moral and Political, 1742

What new or objective criteria are there for beauty in Sustainable Graphic Design?

Ideological, Critical, Beautiful

> “all design is ideological, the design process is informed by values based on a specific world view.”
> — Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, _Design Noir: The Secret Life of Objects_

If our world view is “the welfare of all life,” how does that shift what and how we graphic design?

Dunne and Raby are proponents of “critical design,” design that “provides a critique of the prevailing situation through designs that embody alternative social, cultural, technical, or economic values.”

Sustainable graphic design should be critical of current social, cultural, technical, AND economic structures.

And, the criteria for "beauty" are part of the systems we must be critical of.

Contemporary formal goodness has evolved from modernist ideals born out of the late 19th through the mid-20th centuries and western traditions, which subsequently have been subsequently adopted by business, government, and general society as “good” style.

> Mid-century modernism is so embedded in culture that the "rules" of good graphic designing are just the "rules" of modernism.
> — Jerome Harris

Our sense of good or beautiful design is biased towards these modernist ideals; the same formal and conceptual ideals; as we can see around us, these concepts do not lead to all life flourishing.

Bruce Sterling outlines four criteria for organizing objects:

- Beautiful Things
- Sentimental Things
- Utilitarian Things
- Everything else.

If an object falls into one of the first three categories (beautiful, sentimental, or utilitarian), keep it. If it falls into “Everything Else” be rid of it (or never make it to begin with!).

I think “beauty” in these previous contexts encompasses all Sterling’s "keep" points. Sterling's everything else is the not beautiful, the un-sustainable.

To me, a hammer is utilitarian AND beautiful. To you, it might just be functional. The paintings, drawings, and houseplants I find beautiful are what another might find ugly. The things I find sentimental are probably unique to me. This is okay.

There will be enough overlaps between beauty, utility, and sentimentality that some common ground can be found.

Sustainable graphic design’s "look" must take it’s cue from this: Anything that helps promote the flourishing of nature’s interconnected systems will look correct.

Whether a viewer is turned on by the pure beauty or the utilitarian functionality of a solution matters not, what matters is what is communicated.

That doesn’t require a particular style, material, or typeface

- Nature runs on sunlight.
- Nature uses only energy it needs.
- Nature fits form to function.
- Nature recycles everything.
- Nature rewards cooperation.
- Nature banks on diversity.
- Nature demands local expertise.
- Nature curbs excess from within.
- Nature taps the power of limits.

Biomimicry's tenants don't imply a style, or an aesthetic, but they do give us criteria to judge formal fitness from.

Sustainable aesthetics visualize good ethics

Designers as sustainabilitists = designers as good human beings.

> “There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named.  It is never twice the same, because it always takes its shape from the particular place in which it occurs.”
> — Christopher Alexander

The qualities that promote the welfare of all life are, like the quality without a name, ineffable.

And like the quality without a name, aesthetics that correspond with all life flourishing, shift and change with different contexts.

A wild garden, a cathedral, a monarch butterfly, a thriving farmers market.

Instead of attempting to nail things down literally or concretely, a “feeling” needs to be found instead, or a pattern that can be applied

How might we go about realizing in form how we have aligned ourselves philosophically?

Semiotics: What aesthetics or forms convey a feeling of sustainability?

No aesthetic direction is without expression. Forms convey certain meanings. Typefaces impart different feelings. Images have different intents.

Viewers refer to visual solutions as feeling cold, sterile, corporate, warm, homey, etc.

Is there then a visual solution that conveys “sustainability?”

What about conveying the feeling of "all life flourishing?"

The aesthetic tropes that return when one does a web search for "sustainable aesthetics" or "green graphic design" do  not necessarily convey the feeling of sustainability.

Certainly just turning something green does not correspond with the welfare of all life.

When we say that design communicates what we really mean is that design signals clearly and cleverly.

How should a sustainable object signal? What should a sustainable object signal?

What signals are the best signals for the welfare of all life?

Signs Signaling Sustainability

How do we turn every design opportunity into a sign signaling sustainability?

Make tangible, make understandable something about climate change. This is doable no matter the project; no matter the prompt. There are myriad other aspects of climate change and sustainability one might signal.

This is an opportunity to find the "context" for which "beauty" becomes apparent in a design without resorting to superficial styling.

Amager Bakke Vapor Ring Rendering

A concept that was never made; but that sent me down this direction: Copenhagen waste to energy plant is so clean its exhaust stack puffs only CO2 and water vapor. Upon capturing 1 ton of CO2, exhausts it as a smoke ring. Help you visualize this otherwise intangible!? (Bjarke Ingels Group)

Reverberation Crosswalks

Graham Coreil Allen's _Reverberation Crosswalks_ are fun, brightly colored crosswalks. Paint on cement and asphalt; _Reverberations Crosswalks_ signals a sustainable vector forward. The neighborhood around this intersection is now more walkable. You can't not notice the crosswalks, they're utilitarian if nothing else. They contribute to life flourishing in the city. This concept is cheap; fast; easily replicated; can be customized for region, culture, available materials, etc.

Solar.LowTechMagazine.com

Low Tech Magazine's solar powered website signals how we might visualize energy usage; how we might enable new systems of powering our tools; questions if we really need constant connection; and how aesthetic choices correlate to physical resources even in the digital sphere.

DC High Water Mark Project

The DC water mark project visualizes increased flooding and water level rise — where these impacts will be felt by you in this place! The water level rings articulate "oh shit, this place might be underwater pretty frequently given our current projected future!" Maybe then we can act accordingly and redirect our present towards a future where that is no longer true. Without *seeing* your house or office or favorite park area submerged, even symbolically, you cannot envision an alternative.

FreshPress Paper

Prairie grass and agricultural waste for new paper fiber sources! These papers end up being very low carbon, or even carbon negative, in their footprints.

Are these all objective criteria to then count these solutions as beautiful? I certainly count them as sustainable.

## Conclusion

In prepping this lecture I was looking for the thread that connected my works together. That thread was this question, what does SGD look like, or what is SGD?! Everything I make is a continuous, evolving attempt at answering it.

The definition of sustainable graphic design is easy and hard. Sustainable graphic design is any visual design that sustains the welfare of all life. Sustainable graphic design is hard because, well, what constitutes graphic design that sustains the welfare of all life? What is the _je ne sais quoi_ that makes sustainable design different, more correct, more capable of doing this sustaining?

Our current tools, ideas, and cultural systems aren’t setup to help us to understand this or to manufacture products in this vein. Part of figuring out what sustainable graphic design is means we’ll also have to continue to decide what forms, tools, and new societal structures are required to realize it effectively (& help to design these too).

There is no single way that sustainable graphic design looks, nor a single “correct” way that it is made (what materials it might be, or what processes it includes can be easily sorted into good, bad, ugly, less bad, etc. — but one golden solution does not exist).

What is Sustainable Graphic Design? Anything that visualizes the caretaking of our Spaceship Earth, in any way large or small.

## A Place to Start: Define Sustainable Graphic Design

> The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what it is that you want to sustain.
> — John Ehrenfeld, _Flourishing: A Frank Conversation about Sustainability_

To define sustainable graphic design we must first define what it is we are sustaining.

Here are some definitions of sustainability…

If sustainable graphic design is design in service of what we want to sustain — what's worth sustaining? (this means that if we want to sustain the status quo, then that is what sustainable graphic design is — hmmm!?).

Ehrenfeld wants to sustain “that all humans and other life should flourish.”

Designer Bruce Mau has a similar description for the goals of _Massive Change_: “Our project is the welfare of _all life_ as a practical objective.”

So, sustainable graphic design is “graphic design in support of all life flourishing,” or “graphic design for the welfare of all life.”

Sustainable Graphic Design defined this way is _different_ than status quo, or "regular," cultural production. All life flourishing is not the traditional goal of business, culture, and design.

Throughout art and design history, new thinking and new tools launched new aesthetic outcomes.

Sustainable graphic design requires new and different thinking. Sustainability brings with it all manner of new technologies, new social structures, and new tools.

Sustainable graphic design should then carry with it the potential for different, new styles/aesthetics.

Is selecting a font that uses minimal ink the best way to select a font? Should a font’s or grid’s appearance matter as much as the energy and material and social ills it saves? Would a font that is more condensed and thus uses up less space (saving tons of paper over a print run and exposure to chemicals to the printers) be better? Can we combine the these? The thinest, most condensed, lightest ink coverage font is the most sustainable? This can easily be taken absurd lengths.

This line of design problem solving is limited in its ability to exact meaningful change. It tackles resultant outcomes from a resource perspective; but doesn’t necessarily embrace “the welfare of all life.” Negative effects can be minimized, but is focusing on resource efficiencies enough? Making choices around resource use might make “less bad” graphic design, does it make for _sustainable_ graphic design.

Is there a way to graphic design that uses old materials over and over again?

Can we apply the _Cradle to Cradle_ cyclical idea of _waste = food_ to our graphic designing?

Via the "waste = food" concept, Michael Braungart and William McDonough want us to understand our culture's problematic relationship with waste.

Nature produces no waste; outputs from one system are always inputs for another. Our current design and consumer cultures do not operate in this way.

> designers make garbage.
> Karrie Jacobs,  _Disposability, Graphic Design, Style, and Waste_

Our inputs have only one output, trash! And trash must be sent away; not locally used for making more design…

How can creative waste from a design process become food for other designs/design processes? Is this a way to achieve beauty?

### Example: Green Acres

_Green Acres: Artists Farming Fields, Greenhouses, and Abandoned Lots_ was a book and an exhibition that I worked on with the Curator Sue Spaid for the Contemporary Art Center in Cincinnati, OH. The exhibition featured artists using farming as their main form of practice and expression.

I had a goal to make the resultant book "sustainable" — these were mainly sustainability focused artists, how could I better represent ecological inventiveness in the printed design? However, in the end the only thing that made the production of this book "sustainable" was that it was printed on demand, and printed using recycled, unbleached paper. My thinking was limited to this "try to minimize material or process damage" scope at the time.

Visually, the book was meant to critique commercial farming — juxtaposing artistic field graphics over a constrained grid based on aerial commercial farmland photography. But while the book intends to say something different, it generally conforms to common standards of "good" modernist layout. Other than a minor production method improvement, it's the same … !

There was a glimmer of something else though: Reuse of a format! (or maybe "constraint" or "systems" from _The Sustainabilitist Principles_ ???). Sue had worked on an exhibition 10 years earlier called _Ecovention_. That book was an 8x8 square. So we made _Green Acres_ an 8x8 square to match as a collection.

Do these choices make it "Sustainable Graphic Design?"

### Example: MICA Grad Zine

While this doesn't completely abandon modernist design principles, this mailer for the MICA Graduate Admissions does use imagery, layouts, and a format more closely related to Zine culture. The printing structure was designed to minimize printing waste -- the front and back of this "poster" are printed all as one plate, so the press sheet goes through the press once, then is flipped over, and goes through the press again, voila. This means front and back of the pages were able to all be printed with one plate per color instead of two or more…

### Example: Ecovention Europe

I could also talk about how this book uses colors and space differently than Green Acres, and since it directly reuses the original grids and such can be "critical" even if it doesn't adopt new criteria of review!?

### Example: ICFP Booklet Generator

Here's a utilitarian design solution that could be considered sustainable. The real "design" here is that a web app can output all this conferences materials as a printable PDF, bypassing tons of time in InDesign typesetting it all manually. This is a fairly simple thing, but is project for a client helping with important social sustainability issues... It's not drop dead beautiful, and its certainly not sentimental, but it solves a problem in a clear, repurpose-able way and saved a lot of hours.

### Example: Design for farms? CF2T? FiveSeeds? Whom else?

### Example: Form <> Content <> Context / Economy <> Society <> Nature!?

Do I need to explain some graphics really clearly???

### Example: My sustainability icons?

### Example: The Greenest Green?

### Example: the sustainabilitist principles???

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ is a modular manifesto; a collection of my ideals for designing as a Sustainabilitist; the ways of thinking to create sustainably as considered in 2009. The goal was to create an object whose form directly embodied the principles it conveyed, while also disseminating them. It was a poster, that happened to also be a sculpture, and a novel concept.

Sustainable Design does not exist.

"Sustainable design does not exist" was first a pessimistic "fourth way." Is design all just trash? does design create waste period, so nothing is sustainable? Or, literally, sustainable design is not a thing: anything you are making is unmaking so much else.

But! "Sustainable design does not exist" came to signify an alternative vector; it didn't exist because it was ephemeral! because it reused existing objects in a new way! that it left no trace! suddenly this felt like a prompt for new works; new questions! A useful constraint going forward.

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ was the real example I've made of a design "not existing."

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ started out as me looking at the books on my desk, wondering where "sustainable" design lies within them… my trying to map connections between all these texts… my trying to write about and illustrate these principles I was garnering; the interconnections over time and space of similar ideals…

The final, resulting piece _was_ the actual books from my actual bookshelf. I hadn't needed to make a book to explain these principles; it was doable with the objects themselves! Bring the right parts together in the gallery, and then *poof* everything goes back to its raw materials when the exhibition was over. Design that does not exist (beyond its necessity).

The books were my books. The screen printed definitions, they were printed on title pages and front matter of found paperback novels. The novels went back to the free book exchange where they were found afterward. Even the shape of the "graphic" was meant to use the embroidery floss interconnecting things in the longest possible pieces to maximize reuse of the thread afterward.
