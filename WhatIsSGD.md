# What is Sustainable Graphic Design?

In Flourishing, John Ehrenfeld writes that “The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what it is that you want to sustain.”‡1 So, to define sustainable graphic design we must first define what it is we are sustaining.

Sustainable graphic design is then design in service of what you want to sustain (however, that means that if what we want to sustain is the status quo, then that is what sustainable graphic design is — hmmm). Ehrenfeld wants to sustain “that all humans and other life should flourish.”‡2

Bruce Mau has a similar description for the goals of Massive Change: “Our project is the welfare of all life as a practical objective.”‡3

In this line of reasoning sustainable graphic design is “graphic design in support of all life flourishing” — and sustainable graphic design becomes not just one fixed thing. Sustainable graphic design doesn’t solely rely on better materials or more socially conscious manufacturing. Those things are important, but graphic design framed this way also precludes certain types of projects and certain kinds of clients. Graphic design framed this way presumably morphs over time. Graphic design framed this way opens up the realm of possibilities for what a graphic design project is. Sustainable Graphic Design defined this way is different than status quo design. All life flourishing is not the traditional goal of business, culture, and design.

Throughout art and design history, new thinking and new tools launched new aesthetic outcomes. If sustainable graphic design is different than regular design, it requires different ways of thinking and making. Sustainable graphic design should carry with it different styles/aesthetics.

## What does our “different” kind of design look like?

What visually comes to mind when you read the phrase “sustainable graphic design?” Is there a particular aesthetic a particular color? A particular archetypal client? A particular feeling? A particular message?

What aesthetic is most sustainable? How do we answer this question? Is it even worth asking? What do we base our choices on: energy reduction? Better resource use? Instigating social change?

Is selecting a font that uses minimal ink the best way to select a font? Should a font’s or grid’s appearance matter as much as the energy and material and social ills it saves? Would a font that is more condensed and thus uses up less space (saving tons of paper over a print run and exposure to chemicals to the printers (I guess we should be spec’ing an inert ink as well (can we make our own inks from oak galls and iron ore?))) be better? Can we combine the two? The thinest, most condensed, lightest ink coverage font is the most sustainable? (This can easily be taken absurd lengths). How does this mesh with our earlier definition?

Instead of just reducing or minimizing resources, could we reuse or recycle? Is there a way to graphic design that uses old materials over and over again? Can we apply the cradle to cradle idea of waste = food‡4 to our graphic designing?

This line of design problem solving is limited in its ability to exact meaningful change. It tackles end result outcomes; but doesn’t wholeheartedly embrace “that all life should flourish.” Negative effects can be minimized — but is just focusing on resource efficiencies enough? Making choices purely around resource use might make “less bad” regular graphic design, but it doesn’t necessarily make for sustainable graphic design.

## Ideological, Critical, Beautiful

Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby write in their 2001 book Design Noir: The Secret Life of Objects that “all design is ideological, the design process is informed by values based on a specific world view.”‡5 If our world view is the welfare of all life, then how does that shift what and how we graphic design?

Dunne and Raby are proponents of “critical design,” or design that “provides a critique of the prevailing situation through designs that embody alternative social, cultural, technical, or economic values.”‡6 This is great for our purposes. Graphic design made for the welfare of all life is different than status quo design. So, sustainable graphic design is not just design that helps people and our planet, but design that is also critical of existing social, cultural, technical, AND economic structures (sort of all the options of the Dunne & Raby list, not just one or another at a time).

One way we judge graphic design is on whether or not it is formally “good.” We currently use a set of criteria for formal goodness that are a part of the current systems we’re being critical of. The characteristics we base formal goodness on come from modernist ideals born out of the late 19th century through the middle of the 20th century. What started as avant grade art movements became something adopted by business, government, and general society as “good” style. Our sense of good or beautiful design then is biased towards these modernist ideals co-opted by the status quo. Perhaps those are no longer valid criteria for our sustainable graphic design to be judged on in terms of its formal correctness, or more succinctly, its beauty?

## In this new definition of graphic design, how do we define beauty?

In The Architecture of Happiness, Alain de Botton writes: “To call a work of architecture or design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in a material medium.”‡7 This would then seem that however our ideals — that all humans and life should flourish — can be materialized into graphic design will yield “beautiful” graphic design.

This then implies that for us as Sustainable designers, we must see the non-sustainable as the less than beautiful. Edwin Datschefksi calls this “the hidden ugliness of traditional products.”‡8 Basically, the non-sustainable is (& can only be) ugly.

Beauty will align with your values. A design is both sustainable AND beautiful when its form declares that humans and all other life should flourish. Is there a style, aesthetic, or form says this?

## Sustainable aesthetics visualize good ethics

How might we go about realizing in form how we have aligned ourselves philosophically?

“There is a central quality which is the root criterion of life and spirit in a man, a town, a building, or a wilderness. This quality is objective and precise, but it cannot be named.  It is never twice the same, because it always takes its shape from the particular place in which it occurs.”‡9

Perhaps the issue here is that the qualities that do promote the welfare of all life are ineffable like the quality without a name Alexander presents. So instead of attempting to nail things down literally or concretely something of a “feeling” needs to be found instead?

## What aesthetics or forms convey a feeling of sustainability?

Forms are chosen to convey certain meanings. Typefaces impart different feelings and intents. No aesthetic direction is without expression. Viewers refer to visual solutions as feeling cold, sterile, corporate, warm, homey, etc. Is there a visual solution that conveys the feeling of “sustainability?” What would this be?

A search for sustainable aesthetics in any online engine uncovers leaves, green things, brown things, wood things, bamboo things . . . These are aesthetic tropes that come back again and again, but this does not necessarily convey a feeling of sustainability, just a false visual; formal hyperbole.

Do different visual experiments our class completed from earlier, when coupled together start to convey this? Design doesn’t communicate, design signals. Is a formal style important in this? Design communication happens in a single direction — from the designed piece to the viewer. In this way, it isn’t really communication as much as signaling. Signaling to the user as to what is supposed to be happening. (A tea kettle whistles to let you know it is ready, but the user has no communication back with the tea kettle). When we say that design communicates what we really tend to mean is that design signals clearly and cleverly. We mean it in a one directional, semiotic sense. Sign. Signified.

How does a sustainable object signal? What does a sustainable object signal?

## Relativism And Design? Relativism And Sustainability?

Relativism: the conceptions of truth and moral values are not absolute but are relative to the persons or groups holding them.

That the welfare of all life is important is not relative. Then, that one thing is sustainable and another is not relative. How we go about graphic designing should not be relative either.

## Conclusions?

The definition of sustainable graphic design is both an easy one and hard one. It is easy in that sustainable graphic design is just design that sustains the welfare of all life. That is a short, direct sentence. Easy to describe. It is hard in that what actually constitutes graphic design that does sustain the welfare of all life? What is the je ne sais quoi that makes that sustainable design different, more correct, more capable of doing this sustaining?

Our current tools, ideas, and cultural systems aren’t setup to help us to understand this or to manufacture products in this vein. So, part of figuring out what sustainable graphic design is, means we’ll also have to decide what forms, tools, and new societal structures are required to realize it effectively (& help to design these too). Designers as sustainabilitists = designers as good human beings. :boom:
