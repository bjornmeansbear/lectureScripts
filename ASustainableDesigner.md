# A Sustainable Designer?

Flourishing? Welfare of all life? some kind of intro? Nested circles mindset?

I like to say that I am a "Sustainabilitist" — that is, those interested in creating sustainability, in working ever towards the more sustainable!

We sustainabilitists shall take over where the environmentalists left off, moving from the realm of the environment into all realms; and so we must allow our designs, strategies and methodologies to evolve and adapt to new ideas — accept and deal with a constant state of flux.

## Minor background

I've designed books, record sleeves, magazines, logos, websites, exhibition graphics, and even built a few digital tools… This will mainly be a few casestudies that specifically deal with sustainability, constraint, aesthetics, vernacular … what Sustainable design might "look" like; not just any design...

## The Sustainabilitist Principles

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ is a modular manifesto. It collected my set of "ideals" for how one should approach designing as a Sustainabilitist, the ways of thinking to create more sustainably as I had collected them in 2009. The goal of the piece was to create an object whose form directly emboded the principles, while also diseemenating them. It was a poster, that just happened to be a sculpture.

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ is a good place to start as it visualizes two important concepts for this talk:

1. Sustainable Design does not exist.
2. Everything is Connected.

## What Does Sustainable Graphic Design Look Like?

It's normal to talk about modernists, post-modernists, conceptual minimalists... and know these as novel visual styles. Avant garde visuals from these movements were the result of the ideas to come out of different, often new, ways of thinking. This is not about style for style’s sake, but style  illuminating a theoretical position (style that is arrived at from a thought process, from a set of values, or from hypothesizing and experimenting).

Modernism of the early 20th century was radical! it was meant to be _aesthetically_ different, a different way of seeing and visualizing ... but that came from it being _ideologically_ different from the past as well! The Bauhaus for example, it was against the ornamentation, and for embracing industry. Also it turned design and production torwards the people, not the aristocracy. These were novel! ((Against but in the spirit of modernism, jerome harris))

If "sustainability" requires different ways of thinking (some new, but also, returning to some old ways!?), shouldn’t it carry with it new styles (and/or reuse old ones!?)? We need a new new; or a new old new; or an old remixed new??? Regardless, shouldn't there be something different aesthetically?

This thinking led me to the question: “What does sustainable graphic design look like?" It was meant to inspire my body of works; anything I made in my studio can be anaylzed through this lens -- does this look like sustainable graphic deisgn?

I at a few probable "answers" in my own work:

1. SGD looks the same
2. SGD looks eco-friendly
3. SGD looks innovative
4. SGD does not exist
   - A Pessimistic interpretation?
   - An Optimistic interpretation?

((show lots of examples of my work as I say thiese things, quickly click through them))

"Sustainable design does not exist" came initially from a place of pessimism. Like, is there anything useful design does? or is it really all just trash -- ephemeral waste so nothing is sustainable... like literally, sustainable design is not a thing, anything you are making is unmaking too much... I wasn't  seeing useful opportunity from my other directions... ((Victor papanek there are some disciplines more dangerous? slide))

But! eventually, this came to signify this alternative way forward; it didn't exist because it was ephemeral? or because it reused other existing things in a new way? or that it left no trace? suddenly this started to feel like a prompt for yet more works! A useful constraint to help with new thinking...

## Back to the Work

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_, as I Said before,visualizes two important concepts for this talk:

1. Sustainable Design does not exist.
2. Everything is Connected.

### re: #1, Sustainable Design Doesn't Exist

So in terms of not existing, TSP had a history. There were iterations, me looking at the books on my desk, trying to map connections, trying to write about and illustrate these principles and intellectial interminglings, and finally the end result.

The final, resulting piece _was_ those actual books; my actual bookshelf. I didn't need to turn it into a book to write and explain and illustrate this! I needed to find a way to bring the right parts came together in the gallery to for "poster," and then *poof* everything would go back to its raw materials when the exhibition was over.

So the books were my books. The screen printed definition placards, they were printed on title pages and front matter of found paperback novels to not affect their readability. The novels went back to the free book exchange where they were found afterward... Even The shape of the network was meant to use the embroidery floss connecting things  in the longest possible pieces to maximize reuse of the thread afterward.

This was the perfect end to all the different things I tried, and I've been trying to figure out how to do it again on my projects ever since...

### re: #2, Everything is connected

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ tried to visualize the threads between what I had been reading, what I had been thinking, and what I felt was important. It was meant to show where you could look for more, but also simplify and condense a lot of disparate material into a clearer, more accessible format... Connecting dots, connecting areas of thought...

These important ideas don't just come from one place; time and space and location are all intertwingled and different thinkers and makers in differnt ways arrive at the same kinds of sustainable processes or useful principles...

The sustainabilitist principles is the best place to start because, well, its the closest thing I've made to pure “sustainable graphic design.” And, the principles I outlined in _The Sustainabilitist Principles_ have influenced all the work I've produced since...

Now, Let's see how everything else is connected... where this work, these principles show up in more recent works!

## Any other work or thinking before GA?

## Green Acres

I was doing a variety of work with a contemporary art museum in Baltimore ((show a lot of things??????)), The Contemporary, and the director at the time, Sue Spaid, had an exciting exhibition: _Green Acres: Artists Farming Fields, Greenhouses, and Abandoned Lots_. Artists using farming as their main form of practice and expression. We designed a book for the exhibition, or I guess extend the "exhibition," as there are more works and way more explanation in the book than was possible to do in the galleries.

There was an interest in making the book momre "sustainable" — how to better grasp the content inside in the design. The things that made the production of this book "sustainable" were that it was printed on demand — we had a very short initial run of books, as the audience was estimated to be small, and then printed more when necessary.

As an everything is connected situation... lets jump back to my options for "what SGD looks like?" GA falls into the "It looks the same" category.

Design wise, the book was meant to be a critique of commercial farming — juxtaposing artistic "farmed" graphics over an extremely constrained grid based on aerial photography of commercial farm tracts...

So, its trying to visually tell you something different, but otherwise conforms to the common standards of "good" modernist typography, etc... Other than a minorly improved production method, it's the same as any book...

There is a little Reuse here at lesat — the format! Sue had worked on a book and exhibition earlier called Ecovention, a word she and her collaborator coined short for "Ecological Invention" > trying to categorize these new ways artists were working at the ecological and artistitc avant garde. That book was an 8x8 square. Sue saw these, along with another text for an artist Patricia Johanson, as connected, as a collection, so we made them all the matching physical shape, so that they "fit" together sensically...

## Ecovention Europe

Then, a couple years later, Sue Spaid now living in Belgium, a new exhibition opporutniy comes up. Its called _Ecovention Europe_ and there was going to be another big catalog like GA... This would accompany a new exhibition in the netherlands of European Artists working in the ecological and artistic overlaps...

In the interim since working on GA, I heard a lecture by the designer and author Sara De Bondt. She had recently completed a catalog for the Barbican in London for a similar exhibition to Green Acres. As part of her studio's research leading up to the catalog's production they wrote a manifesto for how they were going to produce the catalog. It reminded me of the sustainabilitist principes; it got me to think again about what other ways design decisions could be made???

In embracing sarah's manifesto, modifying it a bit for our purposes, and then re-examining the design choices of Green Acres. Sue again was thinking this would be useful to design in the matching 8x8 book format again, adding to the collection. How could we re-approach the design of Green Acres? repurpose what we had done already? At this time I happened to be working on a project with one of my classes around recycling, and the 3Rs more generally as design prompts. For this book I too tried to Reduce and Reuse.

Reuse: The grid for Green Acres had a lot of time and conceptual reasoning invested into it. Since Ecovention Europe is a sibling to Green Acres, we reused the Green Acres page layouts. The type choices, grid setup, etc. for this book are lifted from Green Acres and tweaked for the subtle new and different needs required for Ecovention Europe. Sustainable designers routinely find novel ways to reuse materials, there is little discussion for the possibility of reusing visual ideas and solutions, either as an exemplary form of reuse nor as a useful design tool.

Reduce: One goal for the manufacturing of this book is to expend fewer materials than in Green Acres. The idea of "Using less ink" required me to select colours more carefully and to use them more sparingly. No colour in our section palettes adds up to more that 100% ink coverage. (The book uses CMYK: and colour palette selections all start at 100% pure C, M, Y, or K, and then are mixed in equal percentages to keep 100% or less total coverage: 50% + 50%; 33% + 33% + 33%, etc.). Another way I tried to reduce ink was by using bitmapped city maps as the decorative section markers. The feeling of a filled area is kept, but since many pixels end up being blank, much less ink is used. In Green Acres, I used some superficial decorative elements that looked nice but served no functional purpose — they merely took up room. I also ended columns only where a full paragraph ended to make a few things easier from a design perspective. And, while this gave a ragged, formally-nice rhythm to text columns, it was an inefficient use of space in the book. With the layout of Ecovention Europe, I spent time reducing the amount of unused space, thus minimising paper waste.

As a conceptual exercise, this was good. But, did it actually make much of a difference? I don’t know yet. In a book like this, there are a lot of images, yet the artworks don’t adhere to the same ink coverage rules that I set for section colours and body text. One might also ask if I could achieve the look I want using only black, which would save a lot in terms of ink and clean-up over CMYK. Perhaps.

How could this be done differently and better next time? Would a different typeface save ink and space? Are there other ways to handle image inclusion? Is there an alternative to making this? (Should this exist at all? I didn’t ask myself that question before we began.) While I was not prepared to tackle these questions for this book, I will continue exploring and attempting to resolve them with subsequent projects.

## I need something current!?!?!?

## Signs Signalling Sustainability?

## BauErden?

## Climate designers???

## Whats the end!??? I don't know

What does SGD look like?

I still haven’t found a solid solution.

I am currently inclined to believe that there is no single way that sustainable graphic design looks, nor a single “correct” way that it is made (what materials it might be, or what processes it includes can be easily sorted into good, bad, ugly, less bad, etc. — but one golden solution does not exist).

The message revolved around variants of “include sustainable thinking more authentically in your life (and through your life, into your design practice).”

a “correct” style may be irrelevant when it comes to what sustainable graphic design should look like. Maybe it is just the message that matters.

What comes to mind when you hear the phrase “sustainable design?” Brown paper? Soy Ink? Bamboo? Reuse? Is there a particular aesthetic? Is there a particular kind of client? Is there a particular product? Is there a particular visual trope or look or feel? How about a particular message? A particular manufacturing process?

## A Place to Start

John Ehrenfeld states in the book _Flourishing_ “The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what you want to sustain.”

Ehrenfeld wants to sustain that “all humans and other life should flourish” (pg 23).

Using Ehrenfeld’s thinking, Sustainable Graphic Design is design made for clients that believe all life should flourish, design made to promote messages about sustainability-as-flourishing, and design made with materials and processes that promote and sustain the state of flourishing.

Sustainable graphic designers must still make formal decisions. How does the sustainable designer concern themselves with the forms and aesthetics of a solution?

Are there visual choices that are more sustainable?

What form says “I believe that humans and all life should flourish?”

Are aesthetics as they relate to sustainability even important?

## Sustainability and Beauty

> “To call a work of architecture or design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in material medium.” — Alain de Botton, The Architecture of Happiness, pg. 100

In _The Architecture of Happiness_, Alain de Botton provides some insights useful in trying to solve aesthetic quandaries around sustainability and formal beauty.

Beautiful design embodies and sustains the values you hold dear.

Following Botton’s thinking, sustainable designers should see the non-sustainable as the less-than beautiful, even the ugly.

Only truly sustainable things — meaning objects and forms that inspire sustainable ideals — should count as beautiful.

Beautiful things ARE sustainable things, and vice versa.

But, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

This starts to explain why “what does sustainable graphic design looks like?” is such a hard question to answer.

It also explains why Bruce Sterling finds the need to break his list of criteria for deciding quality in objects into four separate entities, and not just “beautiful things” and “everything else.” [[list those things???]]

To me, a nice hammer is functional, utilitarian, and beautiful. To you, it might just be functional.

The paintings and drawings I find beautiful are what another might find ugly.

The things I find sentimental are probably unique to me.

Not everyone has the same idea of what should be sustained as not everyone thinks the same things are beautiful.

Is there really no “correct” aesthetic choice?

## Visual Experiment

The students were very excited about his ideas, but as a group deemed the furniture aesthetically undesirable.

The found materials spoke too loudly, and everything looked “ReUsed” — some of the time in a negative way (purely from an aesthetic stand point). To the students, this proved problematic as

it occurs again and again in green and sustainable design projects: the work wears its heart too much on its sleeve; it looks too eco-friendly and unrefined.

This was not what they wanted for their work nor for Sustainability as a whole.

actively trying to avoid making work looking specifically ReUsed, energy-efficient, or “green.”

The work was meant to just be “good graphic design” — that it should look like other design, yet be more “good” in that it also embraced various aspects of Sustainability.

projects took on different shapes, forms, and styles.

To find new visual themes for sustainable design to draw from.

Some were fantastical; some were practical.

I am a Graphic Designer, was working as such before coming to school, and thus have been approaching the concept of Sustainability through the lens of visual design. This lead to the question I posed myself which deals with both sustainability and design, "What does sustainable graphic design look like???"

This is a random sampling of what I have thus far… these are all just sayings or data that I came up with or came across that I couldn't go on without sharing—perhaps after further revisions and additions this may all become some sort of zine or web publication…

These don't necessarily move the cause forward as much as I would hope either, but they are definitely down a slightly different path that the first studies shown. And as I have moved towards a more theoretical philosophy of sustainability, these studies have become fewer and farther between, replaced instead by writing.

Underlying concepts: green and sustainable might not be the best words to describe sustainable design

My Initial thoughts about how Green and Sustainable are used as adjectives like any others has actually already changed since I began this process. I have now come to the decision that Sustainability has a heft and reality to it that Green does not. Sustainability is broad, and thus capably used in a variety of situations, while Green is a remnant of the aging environmental cause. With this in mind it becomes very important to try and define what sustainability then really means…

An underlying theme I have found in nearly every text and work I have read is this idea of a trinity mentality towards dealing with sustainability. Different people use different terms, but true sustainability always comes down to answering Economic, Societal and Environmental needs together.

As a Venn diagram, sweet spots begin to appear where sustainability in one realm overlaps sustainability in another… Each of these areas can be described as being sustainable in its own way, but only when each takes the other two into consideration will "true sustainability" be met. I see this diagram as "sustainability in action"

This lead to this next diagram, which is more the philosophy of sustainability rather than a working model… This describes the Mindset that gets you to the center sweet spot on the last diagram…

It results from the concept that our economy is a construct of society, and thus would not exist out side of it. likewise, we as humans, and thus out society, would not exist without the greater concept of nature, and thus are contained within it… This creates a holistic view to move forward with, once this concept is grasped, one sees that any decision made in one realm will effect the other two as well, so act accordingly!

With these philosophies in mind, I plan on using them to influence my next round of visuals and further thinking. We are in a post-environmental world, and need to expand our thinking outside of any one realm into the others… These are the stepping stones towards my next set of "things."

## MAKING SUSTAINABLE CHOICES

With my personal theories and philosophies coming together, I have been spending more time attempting to answer my initial question "what does sustainable graphic design look like?"

There are checklist models like LEED for buildings and the Sustainable design checklist, where you simply go down the list and try to comply with as many things as possible… These are a less favored model for me, but valid to at least examine (the sustainable design checklist, it is almost all sacrifice driven, i hate this!)

END: so what does sustainable graphic design look like? I'm still not completely sure, but working on it…
