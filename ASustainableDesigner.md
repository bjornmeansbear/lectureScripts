# A Sustainable Designer?

## The Sustainabilitist Principles

I am going to start with a work, _The Sustainabilitist Principles_. This was a sort of sculptural poster? It encapsulated two important concepts

1. Everything is Connected.
2. Sustainable Design does not exist.

This was really the culmination of my time in Graduate School. I conceived this as a response to a question, a question meant to inspire a body of works: “What does sustainable graphic design look like?"

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ was the conclusion of a process, the amalgmation of all my different ideas at the time. In this piece were all kinds of things coming together… This was pretty much the last thing I made in graduate school; and was really a starting point for all the works I've created since.

Walk through the process of making it?

I had been reading and thinking and researching and making, I had piles of visual experiments, zines, posters, etc. littering my studio space and flat files, but this, this came together at the end as a I said as this encapsualtion

The sustainabilitist principles was a modular manifesto. It collected my set of "ideals" for how one needed to approach designing, the ways of thinking to create more sustainably. And the goal was to create something that would bring all these ideas to visual fruition.

back to this in a sec...

## Sustainable Design does not exist.

It's normal to talk about modernists, post-modernists, conceptual minimalists...

These artists and designers from various movements; the innovators we’ve historically documented are known for novel visuals, but got to those novel visuals by exploring new ideologic territory and experimenting with different ways of thinking. Avant garde visuals stemming from these movements were the result of the ideas (or ideals) to come out of their novel thinking, not really the main ideas themselves. Our past is not about style for style’s sake, but style that illuminates a theoretical position (or at least style that is arrived at from a thought process, from a set of values, or from some set of hypotheses).

Sustainability is a new way of thinking (but also, and old way!?), so shouldn’t it carry with it a new style (or reuse old ones!?)?

So, a question meant to inspire a body of works: “What does sustainable graphic design look like?" resulted in a few "main" potential outcomes in my thining:

1. SGD looks the same
2. SGD looks eco-friendly > the design wears its eco friendliness or social justice advocacy on its sleeve
3. SGD looks innovative
4. SGD does not exist

I meant this last one as pessimism initially, as a, hmmmm is there anything useful design does? or is it really all just trash -- ephemeral waste so nothing is sustainable...

## Other Places of Interest

I want there to be a concrete solution as to what sustainable graphic design looks like. I want it to be different and special. I want it to be better. However, perhaps that is undesirable; perhaps it is against the ideals of sustainability. Part of flourishing is the opportunity for many diverse solutions to a problem. Nature never typically solves any problem in just one way. Successful, resilient systems have many redundancies — that is what makes them resilient. Why shouldn’t sustainability be able to have many styles and aesthetics? Why should there only be one way something looks to be “sustainable?”

Alain de Botton repeatedly references a line from the French writer Stendahl: “there are as many styles of beauty as there are visions of happiness” (pg 100). Perhaps my thinking on sustainable graphic design’s look must take it’s cue from this. Anything that looks in such a way that it helps promote the flourishing of nature’s interconnected systems will look correct. That doesn’t require a particular style, material, or typeface — just the right ideals or messages.

1. Sustainable design does not exist: the piece is made of my actual books; my actual bookshelf. The bits and pieces came together in the gallery to form this sculptural poster, and then *poof* everything went back to the consituent parts when the exhibition was over. The screen printed definition, they were printed on found paperback novels, and are still readable, its only the title pages or other minmal front matter that were printed on. The shape of the structure was also formulated partially to use the emroidery floss that connects things together in the longest possible pieces to maximize use of the floss later... Anyway, so this was sort of the perfect end to all the different things I tried, and I've been trying to figure out how to do it again on my projects ever since...
2. Everything is connected: an aphorism of sorts. I wanted to show how all these different ideas don't just come from one place, and how intertwingled certain repeating principles are...
3. ???

The sustainabilitist principles is the best place to start because, well, its the closest thing I've made to pure “sustainable graphic design”

Everything before aided in its creation, everything after has never been able to do all these things at once.

Constraint?

Thanks for the introduction. I'm kristian bjornard.
I'm going to talk about "Sustainabilitists" -- that is, those interested in creating sustainability.


It slowly rubbed off on me, and started to show a lot more options,

I am going to launch right in with a work called _The Sustainabilitist Principles_. This was really the culmination of my time in Graduate School.

## Green Acres

I was doing a variety of work with a museum in Baltimore, The Contemporary, and the director at the time, Sue Spaid, had an exciting exhibition she was working on: Green Acres. We designed a book to go along with the exhibition -- infact, the book is probably just as much an "exhibition"

Green acres tries to utilize

What comes to mind when you hear the phrase “sustainable graphic design?” Brown paper? Soy Ink? Bamboo? Is there a particular aesthetic? Is there a particular kind of client? Is there a particular product? Is there a particular visual trope or particular look or feel? How about a particular message? A particular manufacturing process?

I've ruminating over this question for years, and I’ve never quite been satisfied with my half-answers. I still haven’t found a solid solution. I am currently inclined to believe that there is no single way that sustainable graphic design looks, nor a single “correct” way that it is made (what materials it might be, or what processes it includes can be easily sorted into good, bad, ugly, less bad, etc. — but one golden solution does not exist). However, I do believe there are some particular messages and clients that are not okay if you are a sustainabilitist.

Where does a designer start in sorting this out?

## A Place to Start

John Ehrenfeld states in the book _Flourishing_ “The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what you want to sustain.” Ehrenfeld wants to sustain that “all humans and other life should flourish” (pg 23). Using Ehrenfeld’s thinking, Sustainable Graphic Design is design made for clients that believe all life should flourish, design made to promote messages about sustainability-as-flourishing, and design made with materials and processes that promote and sustain the state of flourishing too.

Graphic designers are form makers. Sustainable graphic designers must make formal decisions. How does the sustainable designer concern themselves with the forms and aesthetics of a solution? Are there visual choices that are more sustainable? What form says “I believe that humans and all life should flourish?” Are aesthetics as they relate to sustainability even important?

These are complicated questions.

## Sustainability and Beauty.

> “To call a work of architecture or design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in material medium.” — Alain de Botton, The Architecture of Happiness, pg. 100

In _The Architecture of Happiness_, Alain de Botton provides some insights useful in trying to solve aesthetic quandaries around sustainability and formal beauty. Beautiful design embodies and sustains the values you hold dear.

Following Botton’s thinking, sustainable designers should see the non-sustainable as the less-than beautiful, even the ugly. Only truly sustainable things — meaning objects and forms that inspire sustainable ideals — should count as beautiful. Beautiful things ARE sustainable things, and vice versa.

Burgeoning sustainabilitists wishing to de-clutter their lives may come across [a piece by Bruce Sterling](http://viridiandesign.org/) that echoes similar sentiments. Sterling outlines four criteria for sorting through the objects you own so as to decide what to keep and what to discard as a part of your new, sustainably designed life.

1. Beautiful Things
2. Sentimental Things
3. Utilitarian Things
4. Everything else.

If an object in your possession fits into the first three categories (beautiful, sentimental, or utilitarian things), then it is worth keeping. If it falls into “Everything Else” you must be rid of it. Sterling is interested in these categories from the point of view that sustainabilitists should have the right stuff — right meaning the best functioning, most meaningful, prettiest stuff. By virtue of being objects that you really need or want to have around just by being so lovely to look at, these things rise above just plain detritus to become more valuable, more sustainable objects (even if it just means you replace them less often).

When Alain de Botton talks about beauty in design and architecture, I think his “beauty” encompasses all of Sterling’s top 3 categories.

But, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This starts to explain why “what does sustainable graphic design looks like?” is such a hard question to answer. It also explains why Sterling found the need to break his list of criteria four separate entities, and not just “beautiful things” and “everything else.” To me, a nice hammer is functional, utilitarian, and beautiful. To you, it might just be functional. The paintings and drawings I find beautiful are what another might find ugly. The things I find sentimental are probably unique to me. Not everyone has the same idea of what should be sustained as not everyone thinks the same things are beautiful.

Is there really no “correct” aesthetic choice?

## Visual Experiment.

A guest came to class to present his work. He designs and builds furniture exclusively from reclaimed materials. The students were very excited about his ideas, but as a group deemed the furniture aesthetically undesirable. The found materials spoke too loudly, and everything looked “ReUsed” — some of the time in a negative way (purely from an aesthetic stand point). To the students, this proved problematic as it occurs again and again in green and sustainable design projects: the work wears its heart too much on its sleeve; it looks too eco-friendly and unrefined. This was not what they wanted for their work nor for Sustainability as a whole. In their projects, many of the students were actively trying to make work that avoided looking specifically ReUsed, energy-efficient, or “green.” The work was meant to just be “good graphic design” — that it should look like other design, yet be more “good” in that it also embraced various aspects of Sustainability.

Toward this end, student’s projects took on different shapes, forms, and styles. Of general interest was to avoid the current tropes of “greenness” or “eco-friendly-ness.” To find new visual themes for sustainable design to draw from. Some formal solutions were influenced by their concepts, some forms directly influenced by materials (though not in as earnest a way as the furniture maker’s works), and some just looked like regular old graphic design. Some were fantastical; some were practical. Regardless of their speculativeness, none of the project directions ended up being “wrong” as a sustainable design project. All the student’s projects have in some way attempted to solve what it means to be “sustainable graphic design,” and many aesthetic and conceptual approaches were used.

Each student sorted out for themselves what might be both a sustainable and a beautiful design solution. The one thing all works this term did share in common was the message — not a style, not a material, but a recurring message. The message revolved around variants of “include sustainable thinking more authentically in your life (and through your life, into your design practice).”

My students’s works this term have shown me that a “correct” style may be irrelevant when it comes to what sustainable graphic design should look like. Maybe it is just the message that matters.
