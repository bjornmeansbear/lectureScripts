# A Sustainable Designer?

I'm going to talk about "Sustainabilitists" -- that is, those interested in creating sustainability, in working ever towards the more sustainable! And I intend designing and how design might change in terms of forms, outputs, aesthetics when viewed through "Sustainabilitism"

What comes to mind when you hear the phrase “sustainable graphic design?” Brown paper? Soy Ink? Bamboo? Is there a particular aesthetic? Is there a particular kind of client? Is there a particular product? Is there a particular visual trope or particular look or feel? How about a particular message? A particular manufacturing process?

I've ruminating over this question for years, and I’ve never quite been satisfied with much of what I've done — except for one thing …

## The Sustainabilitist Principles

I am going to start with a work, _The Sustainabilitist Principles_. This was a sort of sculptural poster? It encapsulated two important concepts

1. Sustainable Design does not exist.
2. Everything is Connected.

I conceived this as a response to a question, a question meant to inspire a body of works: “What does sustainable graphic design look like?"

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ was the conclusion of a process, the amalgmation of all my different ideas at the time. In this piece were all kinds of things coming together… This was pretty much the last thing I made in graduate school; and was really a starting point for all the works I've created since.

Walk through the process of making it?

I had been reading and thinking and researching and making, I had piles of visual experiments, zines, posters, etc. littering my studio space and flat files, but this, this came together at the end as a I said as this encapsualtion

The sustainabilitist principles was a modular manifesto. It collected my set of "ideals" for how one needed to approach designing, the ways of thinking to create more sustainably. And the goal was to create something that would bring all these ideas to visual fruition.

## Sustainable Design does not exist

It's normal to talk about modernists, post-modernists, conceptual minimalists...

These artists and designers from various movements; the innovators we’ve historically documented are known for novel visuals, but got to those novel visuals by exploring new ideologic territory and experimenting with different ways of thinking. Avant garde visuals stemming from these movements were the result of the ideas (or ideals) to come out of their novel thinking, not really the main ideas themselves. Our past is not about style for style’s sake, but style that illuminates a theoretical position (or at least style that is arrived at from a thought process, from a set of values, or from some set of hypotheses).

Sustainability is a new way of thinking (but also, and old way!?), so shouldn’t it carry with it a new style (or reuse old ones!?)?

So, a question meant to inspire a body of works: “What does sustainable graphic design look like?" resulted in a few "main" potential outcomes in my thining:

1. SGD looks the same
2. SGD looks eco-friendly > the design wears its eco friendliness or social justice advocacy on its sleeve
3. SGD looks innovative
4. SGD does not exist

I meant this last one as pessimism initially, as a, hmmmm is there anything useful design does? or is it really all just trash -- ephemeral waste so nothing is sustainable...

## Other Places of Interest

I want there to be a concrete solution as to what sustainable graphic design looks like. I want it to be different and special. I want it to be better. However, perhaps that is undesirable; perhaps it is against the ideals of sustainability. Part of flourishing is the opportunity for many diverse solutions to a problem. Nature never typically solves any problem in just one way. Successful, resilient systems have many redundancies — that is what makes them resilient. Why shouldn’t sustainability be able to have many styles and aesthetics? Why should there only be one way something looks to be “sustainable?”

Alain de Botton repeatedly references a line from the French writer Stendahl: “there are as many styles of beauty as there are visions of happiness” (pg 100). Perhaps my thinking on sustainable graphic design’s look must take it’s cue from this. Anything that looks in such a way that it helps promote the flourishing of nature’s interconnected systems will look correct. That doesn’t require a particular style, material, or typeface — just the right ideals or messages.

## Back to the Works

So, as a piece, The sustainabilist principles was an example for Sustainable design does not existing

re: #1, Sustainable Design Doesn't Exist:

The piece is made of my actual books; my actual bookshelf. The bits and pieces came together in the gallery to form this sculptural poster, and then *poof* everything went back to the consituent parts when the exhibition was over. The screen printed definitions, they were printed on found paperback novels, so the novels were still readable, its only the title pages or other minmal front matter that were printed on. The shape of the structure was also formulated partially to use the emroidery floss that connects things together in the longest possible pieces to maximize reuse of the floss later... Anyway, so this was sort of the perfect end to all the different things I tried, and I've been trying to figure out how to do it again on my projects ever since...

re: #2, Everything is connected:

an aphorism of sorts. I wanted to show how all these different ideas don't just come from one place, and how intertwingled certain repeating principles are... That writers and practitioners from different eras continue to talk about the same key things... The other way "everything is connected" is that Everything I did and made before TSP influenced its creation, and everything I've done after has had its trajectory defined based on the ideas here — though no work since has ever been able to do as much of these things at once.

The sustainabilitist principles is the best place to start because, well, its the closest thing I've made to pure “sustainable graphic design”

Let;s see how everything else is connected...

## Green Acres

I was doing a variety of work with a museum in Baltimore, The Contemporary, and the director at the time, Sue Spaid, had an exciting exhibition she was working on: _Green Acres: Artists Farming Fields, Greenhouses, and Abandoned Lots_. We designed a book to go along with the exhibition, or I guess extend the "exhibition," as there are more works and more explanation in the book than was possible.

This is going to be an everything is connected situation... so lets jump back to our options for "what SGD looks like?"

GA falls into the "It looks the same" category.

Really, the things that made the production of this book "sustainable" were that it was printed on demand — we had a very short run of books, and then printed more when necessary.

Design wise, the book was meant to be a critique of commercial farming — juxtaposing artistic "farmed" graphics over an extremely constrained grid based on aerial photography of commercial farm tracts...

So, its trying to visually tell you something different, but otherwise conforms to the common standards of "good" modernist typography, etc... It has a minorly improved production method...

Now, there is a little Reuse here at lesat — the format! Sue had worked on a book almost 10 years earlier called Ecovention, a word she and her collaborator coined short for "Ecoogical Invention" > trying to categorize these new ways artists were working at the ecological and artistitc avant garde … That book was an 8x8 square. Sue saw these, along with another text for an artist Patricia Johanson, as connected, as a sort of collection, so I made them all the matching physical shape, so they "fit" together sensically... (Everything is connect???)

## Ecovention Europe

Then, a couple years later, Sue Spaid now living in Belgium, a new exhibition opporutniy comes up. Its called _Ecovention Europe_ and there was going to be another big catalog like GA...

In the interim since working on GA, I heard a lecture by the designer and author Sarah De Bondt. She had recently completed a catalog for the Barbican in London for a similar exhibition to Green Acres. As part of her teams research leading up to the catalog's production they wrote a manifesto for how they were going to produce the catalog.

[[Show the manifesto?]]

It reminded me of things that I guess I had been ignoring from my The Principles!

So, in embracing sarah's manifesto, modifying it a bit for my own purposes, and then re-examining my own past works...

How could we re-approach the design of Green Acres? repurpose what I had done already? I tried to Reduce and Reuse.

Reuse: Sue Spaid and I worked on Green Acres: Artists Farming Fields, Greenhouses and Abandoned Lots together in 2012. The grid for Green Acres had a lot of time and conceptual reasoning invested into it. Since Ecovention Europe is a sort of sibling to Green Acres, we decided to reuse the Green Acres page layout templates. The type choices, grid setup, etc. for this book are lifted from Green Acres and tweaked for the minor new and different needs required for Ecovention Europe. Although sustainable designers routinely find novel ways to reuse materials, I’ve found little discussion for the possibility of reusing ideas and solutions, either as an exemplary form of reuse nor as a useful design tool.

Reduce: One goal for the manufacturing of this book is to expend fewer materials, most noticeably ink, than in the previous tomes I’ve designed. Using less ink required me to select colours more carefully and to use them more sparingly. No colour adds up to more that 100% ink coverage. (The book uses CMYK: and colour palette selections all start at 100% pure C, M, Y, or K, and then are mixed in equal percentages to keep 100% or less total coverage: 50% + 50%; 33% + 33% + 33%, etc.). Another way I tried to reduce ink was by using bitmapped city maps as the decorative section markers. The feeling of a filled area is kept, but since many pixels end up being blank, much less ink is used. Attempts to keep things from bleeding and to fill each page’s grid completely were also made (reduce paper, reduce ink). In Green Acres, I used some superficial decorative elements that looked nice but served no functional purpose — they merely took up room. I also ended columns only where a full paragraph ended to make a few things easier from a design perspective (less has to change if something is added or removed while things are being finalised; you don’t have to deal with as many annoying line or paragraph breaks across columns, etc.). So, while this gave a ragged, formally-nice flow to text columns, it was an inefficient use of space in the book. With the layout of Ecovention Europe, I spent a lot of effort reducing the amount of unused space, thus minimising paper waste (however, more time was used, still a resource not to be wasted).

As a conceptual exercise, this was good. But, did it actually make much of a difference? I don’t know yet. In a book like this, there are a lot of images, yet the artworks don’t adhere to the same ink coverage rules that I set for section colours and body text. One might also ask if I could achieve the look I want using only black, which would save a lot in terms of ink and clean-up over CMYK. Perhaps.

How could this be done differently and better next time? Would a different typeface save ink and space? Are there other ways to handle image inclusion? Is there an alternative to making this? (Should this exist at all? I didn’t ask myself that question before we began.) While I was not prepared to tackle these questions for this book, I will continue exploring and attempting to resolve them with subsequent projects.

Colors? Page Count? Wasted Space? Decoration?

The design of ecovention europe ...

## Signs Signalling Sustainability?

## Whats the end!??? I don't know

What does SGD look like?

I still haven’t found a solid solution.

I am currently inclined to believe that there is no single way that sustainable graphic design looks, nor a single “correct” way that it is made (what materials it might be, or what processes it includes can be easily sorted into good, bad, ugly, less bad, etc. — but one golden solution does not exist).

The message revolved around variants of “include sustainable thinking more authentically in your life (and through your life, into your design practice).”

a “correct” style may be irrelevant when it comes to what sustainable graphic design should look like. Maybe it is just the message that matters.

## A Place to Start

John Ehrenfeld states in the book _Flourishing_ “The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what you want to sustain.”

Ehrenfeld wants to sustain that “all humans and other life should flourish” (pg 23).

Using Ehrenfeld’s thinking, Sustainable Graphic Design is design made for clients that believe all life should flourish, design made to promote messages about sustainability-as-flourishing, and design made with materials and processes that promote and sustain the state of flourishing too.

Sustainable graphic designers must make formal decisions.

How does the sustainable designer concern themselves with the forms and aesthetics of a solution?

Are there visual choices that are more sustainable?

What form says “I believe that humans and all life should flourish?”

Are aesthetics as they relate to sustainability even important?

These are complicated questions.

## Sustainability and Beauty

> “To call a work of architecture or design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in material medium.” — Alain de Botton, The Architecture of Happiness, pg. 100

In _The Architecture of Happiness_, Alain de Botton provides some insights useful in trying to solve aesthetic quandaries around sustainability and formal beauty.

Beautiful design embodies and sustains the values you hold dear.

Following Botton’s thinking, sustainable designers should see the non-sustainable as the less-than beautiful, even the ugly.

Only truly sustainable things — meaning objects and forms that inspire sustainable ideals — should count as beautiful.

Beautiful things ARE sustainable things, and vice versa.

But, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

This starts to explain why “what does sustainable graphic design looks like?” is such a hard question to answer.

It also explains why Sterling found the need to break his list of criteria four separate entities, and not just “beautiful things” and “everything else.”

To me, a nice hammer is functional, utilitarian, and beautiful. To you, it might just be functional.

The paintings and drawings I find beautiful are what another might find ugly.

The things I find sentimental are probably unique to me.

Not everyone has the same idea of what should be sustained as not everyone thinks the same things are beautiful.

Is there really no “correct” aesthetic choice?

## Visual Experiment

He designs and builds furniture exclusively from reclaimed materials.

The students were very excited about his ideas, but as a group deemed the furniture aesthetically undesirable.

The found materials spoke too loudly, and everything looked “ReUsed” — some of the time in a negative way (purely from an aesthetic stand point). To the students, this proved problematic as

it occurs again and again in green and sustainable design projects: the work wears its heart too much on its sleeve; it looks too eco-friendly and unrefined.

This was not what they wanted for their work nor for Sustainability as a whole.

actively trying to avoid making work looking specifically ReUsed, energy-efficient, or “green.”

The work was meant to just be “good graphic design” — that it should look like other design, yet be more “good” in that it also embraced various aspects of Sustainability.

projects took on different shapes, forms, and styles.

Of general interest was to avoid the current tropes of “greenness” or “eco-friendly-ness.”

To find new visual themes for sustainable design to draw from.

Some were fantastical; some were practical.
