# A Sustainable Designer?

I like to say that I am a "Sustainabilitist" — that is, one interested in creating sustainability, one interested in working ever towards the sustainable!

Sustainabilitists take over where environmentalism ends, moving from only the realm of the environment into all realms. We must allow our designs, strategies and methodologies to evolve and adapt to new ideas — accept and deal with a constant state of flux between nature, society, economy — everything.

## Quick Background

I've designed books, record sleeves, magazines, logos, websites, exhibition graphics, and build  digital tools… Regardless of the final forms, or if its client based or self-initiated, I treat all design projects as opportunities for intellectual inquiry and self-expression.

This talk consists of case-studies dealing with sustainability and its principles: constraint, aesthetics, vernacular, reuse, interconnection … and more broadly I'll discuss "what Sustainable Aesthetics might look like." …

## The Sustainabilitist Principles

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ is a modular manifesto; a collection of my ideals for designing as a Sustainabilitist; the ways of thinking to create sustainably as considered in 2009. The goal was to create an object whose form directly embodied the principles it conveyed, while also disseminating them. It was a poster, that happened to also be a sculpture, and a novel concept.

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ visualizes two important concepts:

1. Sustainable Design does not exist.
2. Everything is Connected.

We'll get back to this in a sec, but first a quick detour…

## Detour1: What Does Sustainable Graphic Design Look Like?

It's normal to talk about constructivists, modernists, conceptual minimalists, etc.; and know these as novel visual styles for their time and space. Avant garde visuals from these movements came from different ways of thinking that the communities responsible their creation explored. Modernism (for instance) was not about style for style’s sake, but style illuminating a novel theoretical position; style that was arrived at from a thought process, from a set of values, or from hypothesizing and experimenting.

If "sustainability" requires different ways of thinking (some new, & also, returning to old ways!?), shouldn’t it carry with it some kind of new style (and/or reuse old ones!?)? We need a new new (or a new old; or an old remixed new???). Shouldn't there be something different aesthetically about sustainability? Designing for the welfare of all life is certainly a different mindset from designing for the corporate marketplace... do these things need to then look different?

((welfare of all life?))

This thinking led me to this overarching question: “What does sustainable graphic design look like?" For me, it inspired a whole body of work; anything I made in my studio should be analyzed through this lens -- does this look like sustainable graphic design?

I have seen a few recurring “answers” in my work and work from the field:

1. SGD looks the same.
2. SGD looks eco-friendly.
3. SGD looks innovative.
4. SGD does not exist.
   - A Pessimistic interpretation?
   - An Optimistic interpretation?

((Click through lots of examples of my work as I say these things))

"Sustainable design does not exist" was first a pessimistic "fourth way." Is design all just trash? does design create waste period, so nothing is sustainable? Or, literally, sustainable design is not a thing: anything you are making is unmaking so much else.

((Victor Papanek there are some disciplines more dangerous? slide))

But! "Sustainable design does not exist" came to signify an alternative vector; it didn't exist because it was ephemeral! because it reused existing objects in a new way! that it left no trace! suddenly this felt like a prompt for new works; new questions! A useful constraint going forward.

((Future cone!?)) ((Instead of problem solving, why not problem finding))

## Back to the Work

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_, visualizes two important concepts for this talk:

1. Sustainable Design does not exist.
2. Everything is Connected.

### re: 1, Sustainable Design Doesn't Exist

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ was the real example I've made of a design "not existing."

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ started out as me looking at the books on my desk, wondering where "sustainable" design lies within them… my trying to map connections between all these texts… my trying to write about and illustrate these principles I was garnering; the interconnections over time and space of similar ideals…

The final, resulting piece _was_ the actual books from my actual bookshelf. I hadn't needed to make a book to explain these principles; it was doable with the objects themselves! Bring the right parts together in the gallery, and then *poof* everything goes back to its raw materials when the exhibition was over. Design that does not exist (beyond its necessity).

The books were my books. The screen printed definitions, they were printed on title pages and front matter of found paperback novels. The novels went back to the free book exchange where they were found afterward. Even the shape of the "graphic" was meant to use the embroidery floss interconnecting things in the longest possible pieces to maximize reuse of the thread afterward. 

### re: 2, Everything is connected

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ visualized what I had been reading, what I had been thinking. It connected content from different decades, from different disciplines. _The Sustainabilitist Principles_ showed you where you could look for more. It simplified and condensed a lot of disparate material into a clearer, more accessible format. 

Connecting dots, connecting areas of thought, letting a newcomer get further faster!

Ideas never come from one place; time and space and location are all intertwingled and different thinkers and makers in arrive at similar processes and useful principles through different paths.

So the content is interconnected; but also the form! The way _The Sustainabilitist Principles_ ended up visually is a form of connection too. 

((Show _The Greenest Green_))

_The Sustainabilitist Principles_ is the closest thing I've made to pure “sustainable graphic design.” And, the principles I outlined within have influenced all the work I've produced since...

Now, Let's see how else everything is connected: where these principles show up in more recent works!

## Green Acres

_Green Acres_ ended up being an example of "SGD looks the same."

I was doing a variety of work with The Contemporary, an art museum in Baltimore …

(show a lot of things??????))

… and the director, Sue Spaid, had an exciting exhibition planned, with Artists using farming as their main form of practice and expression: _Green Acres: Artists Farming Fields, Greenhouses, and Abandoned Lots_. We designed a book for the exhibition.

I had a goal to make the book "sustainable." These were mainly sustainability focused artists, how could I better represent ecological inventiveness in the printed design? In the end the only thing that made the production of this book "sustainable" was that it was printed on demand, and printed using recycled, unbleached paper.

Visually, the book was meant to critique commercial farming — juxtaposing more artistic graphics over an extremely constrained grid based on aerial photography of commercial farmland. The book intends to say something different, but generally conforms to common standards of "good" modernist layout. Other than a minor production method improvement, it's the same … !

There was a glimmer of something else though: Reuse of a format! (or maybe "constraint" or "systems" from _The Sustainabilitist Principles_ ???). Sue had worked on an exhibition 10 years earlier called _Ecovention_. That book was an 8x8 square. So we made _Green Acres_ an 8x8 square to match as a collection.

## Ecovention Europe

A couple of years later, Sue Spaid, now living in Belgium, gets a new exhibition opportunity. She calls it _Ecovention Europe_ — ecologically inventive artists specifically working in Europe  — and there was to be another catalog.

In the interim since _Green Acres_, I saw a lecture by the designer Sara De Bondt, where Sara discusses the _Radical Nature_ catalog her team designed for the Barbican in London. De Bondt's studio wrote a sustainable printing manifesto as part of the research for the catalog's production.

((show manifesto???))

De Bondt's "manifesto" got me thinking about what other ways design decisions could be made, how could I embrace some of my old ideas from say, _The Sustainabilitist Principles_?

## Detour2: Vernacular Design?

## Back to the work, again

Re-examine the design choices of _Green Acres_ For _Ecovention Europe_ … 

How might I make yet another 8x8 book, and drastically improve the sustainability (or at least the sustainable aesthetics) this time around? How could we re-approach the design of _Green Acres_, repurposing what we had done already?

At this time I happened to be working on a project with a class around the 3Rs as design prompts (reduce, reuse, recycle). For _Ecovention Europe_ I decided to "Reduce" and "Reuse" my efforts on _Green Acres_.

So …

### Reduce

One of the items in De Bondt's printing manifesto is use less ink. The idea of "Using less ink" meant selecting colors more carefully and to use them more sparingly. 

No color adds up to more that 100% ink coverage. (_Ecovention Europe_ uses CMYK: and color palette swatches start at 100% pure C, M, Y, or K, and then are mixed in equal percentages to keep 100% or less total coverage: 50% + 50%; 33% + 33% + 33%; etc.).

Another way I tried to reduce ink was bitmapped city maps as the decorative new section markers. The appearance of a filled area is kept (relating back to a _Green Acres_ design choice), but much less ink is used as compared to a filled and full bleed grayscale or CMYK variant.

Text columns in Green Acres ended where a full paragraph ended to make a few things easier from a design perspective. Yes, this gave a ragged, formally-nice rhythm to text columns, but it was an inefficient use of space. With _Ecovention Europe_, I spent time reducing the amount of unused space (this also minimized superfluous decoration — In _Green Acres_, superficial decorative elements that looked nice but served no functional purpose were all blank page areas.

### Reuse

The grid for _Green Acres_ had a lot of conceptual reasoning invested into it, and so I reused the page templates, type choices, grid setup, etc. 

Sustainable designers routinely find novel ways to reuse materials, but I felt that there was little discussion for the possibility of reusing visuals and solutions.

Printing on demand was a concept also reused.

As a conceptual exercise, this was good. But, did it actually make much of a difference? In a book like this, there are a lot of images, and the artworks didn’t adhere to the same ink coverage rules.

How could this be done differently and improved upon again next time? Would a different typeface save ink and space? Are there other ways to handle image inclusion? Is there an alternative to making this book at all? (Should this exist? I didn’t ask that question before we began!).

- _Ecovention Europe_ is maybe in the "the same" category, but is it moving into the "innovative" or "doesn't exist" category? 
- Where else does everything is connected fit in?

## I need something current!?!?!?

## Signs Signaling Sustainability?

## BauErden?

## Climate designers???

## Whats the end!???

What does SGD look like?

I am currently inclined to believe that there is no single way that sustainable graphic design looks, nor a single “correct” way that it is made (what materials it might be, or what processes it includes can be easily sorted into good, bad, ugly, less bad, etc. — but one golden solution does not exist). 

A “correct” style may be irrelevant when it comes to what sustainable graphic design should look like.

What comes to mind when you hear the phrase “sustainable design?” Brown paper? Soy Ink? Bamboo? Reuse? Is there a particular aesthetic? Is there a particular kind of client? Is there a particular product? Is there a particular visual trope or look or feel? How about a particular message? A particular manufacturing process?

so what does sustainable graphic design look like? I'm still not completely sure, but working on it…

## A Place to Start

John Ehrenfeld states in the book _Flourishing_ “The key to doing something about sustainability is that you first have to say what you want to sustain.”

Ehrenfeld wants to sustain that “all humans and other life should flourish” (pg. 23).

Using Ehrenfeld’s thinking, Sustainable Graphic Design is design made for clients that believe all life should flourish, design made to promote messages about sustainability-as-flourishing, and design made with materials and processes that promote and sustain the state of flourishing.

Sustainable graphic designers must still make formal decisions. How does the sustainable designer concern themselves with the forms and aesthetics of a solution?

Are there visual choices that are more sustainable?

What form says “I believe that humans and all life should flourish?”

Are aesthetics as they relate to sustainability even important?

## Sustainability and Beauty

> “To call a work of architecture or design beautiful is to recognize it as a rendition of values critical to our flourishing. A transubstantiation of our individual ideals in material medium.” — Alain de Botton, The Architecture of Happiness, pg. 100

In _The Architecture of Happiness_, Alain de Botton provides some insights useful in trying to solve aesthetic quandaries around sustainability and formal beauty.

Beautiful design embodies and sustains the values you hold dear.

Following Botton’s thinking, sustainable designers should see the non-sustainable as the less-than beautiful, even the ugly.

Only truly sustainable things — meaning objects and forms that inspire sustainable ideals — should count as beautiful.

Beautiful things ARE sustainable things, and vice versa.

But, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

This starts to explain why “what does sustainable graphic design looks like?” is such a hard question to answer.

It also explains why Bruce Sterling finds the need to break his list of criteria for deciding quality in objects into four separate entities, and not just “beautiful things” and “everything else.” [[list those things???]]

To me, a nice hammer is functional, utilitarian, and beautiful. To you, it might just be functional.

The paintings and drawings I find beautiful are what another might find ugly.

The things I find sentimental are probably unique to me.

Not everyone has the same idea of what should be sustained as not everyone thinks the same things are beautiful.

Is there really no “correct” aesthetic choice?

## Visual Experiment

Materials spoke too loudly, and everything looked “ReUsed” — some of the time in a negative way (purely from an aesthetic stand point). To the students, this proved problematic as

it occurs again and again in green and sustainable design projects: the work wears its heart too much on its sleeve; it looks too eco-friendly and unrefined.

This was not what they wanted for their work nor for Sustainability as a whole.

actively trying to avoid making work looking specifically ReUsed, energy-efficient, or “green.”

The work was meant to just be “good graphic design” — that it should look like other design, yet be more “good” in that it also embraced various aspects of Sustainability.

To find new visual themes for sustainable design to draw from.

The message revolved around variants of “include sustainable thinking more authentically in your life (and through your life, into your design practice).”

I am a Graphic Designer, was working as such before graduate school, and have been generally approaching the concept of Sustainability through the lens of visual design. This lead to the question I posed myself which deals with both sustainability and design, "What does sustainable graphic design look like???"

I have moved towards a more theoretical philosophy of sustainability.

An underlying theme I have found in nearly every text and work I have read is this idea of a trinity mentality towards dealing with sustainability — The triple bottom line it is typically referred to. Different people use different terms, but true sustainability always comes down to answering Economic, Societal and Environmental needs together.

As a Venn diagram, sweet spots appear where sustainability in one realm overlaps sustainability in another. Each of these areas can be described as being sustainable in its own way, but only when each takes both the others into consideration will "true sustainability" be met. This is "sustainability in action"

This leads to this next diagram, more the philosophy of sustainability; the Mindset that gets you to the center sweet spot on the last diagram. The concept is that our economy is a construct of society, and cannot exist out side of it. likewise, we as humans, thus our society, would not exist without the greater concept of nature, and are contained within it. This creates a holistic view to move forward, once this concept is grasped, one sees that any decision made in one realm will effect the other two as well, so act accordingly! Any economic choice IS an environmental choice.

We are in a post-environmental world, and need to expand our thinking outside of any one realm into the others… These are the stepping stones towards my next set of "things."
